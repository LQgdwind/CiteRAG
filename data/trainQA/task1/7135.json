Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Robotic Table Wiping via Reinforcement Learning and Whole-body Trajectory Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a framework to enable multipurpose assistive mobile robots to autonomously wipe tables to clean spills and crumbs. This problem is challenging, as it requires planning wiping actions while reasoning over uncertain latent dynamics of crumbs and spills captured via high-dimensional visual observations. Simultaneously, we must guarantee constraints satisfaction to enable safe deployment in unstructured cluttered environments. To tackle this problem, we first propose a stochastic differential equation to model crumbs and spill dynamics and absorption with a robot wiper. Using this model, we train a vision-based policy for planning wiping actions in simulation using reinforcement learning (RL). To enable zero-shot sim-to-real deployment, we dovetail the RL policy with a whole-body trajectory optimization framework to compute base and arm joint trajectories that execute the desired wiping motions while guaranteeing constraints satisfaction. We extensively validate our approach in simulation and on hardware.
