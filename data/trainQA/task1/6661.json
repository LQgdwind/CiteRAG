Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Encoding Integers and Rationals on Neuromorphic Computers using Virtual Neuron\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Neuromorphic computers perform computations by emulating the human brain, and use extremely low power. They are expected to be indispensable for energy-efficient computing in the future. While they are primarily used in spiking neural network-based machine learning applications, neuromorphic computers are known to be Turing-complete, and thus, capable of general-purpose computation. However, to fully realize their potential for general-purpose, energy-efficient computing, it is important to devise efficient mechanisms for encoding numbers. Current encoding approaches have limited applicability and may not be suitable for general-purpose computation. In this paper, we present the virtual neuron as an encoding mechanism for integers and rational numbers. We evaluate the performance of the virtual neuron on physical and simulated neuromorphic hardware and show that it can perform an addition operation using 232323 nJ of energy on average using a mixed-signal memristor-based neuromorphic processor. We also demonstrate its utility by using it in some of the Œºùúá\\mu-recursive functions, which are the building blocks of general-purpose computation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
