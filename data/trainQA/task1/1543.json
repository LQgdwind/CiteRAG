Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: CorDEL: A Contrastive Deep Learning Approach for Entity Linkage\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Entity linkage (EL) is a critical problem in data cleaning and integration. In the past several decades, EL has typically been done by rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models with hand-curated features, both of which heavily depend on manual human inputs. With the ever-increasing growth of new data, deep learning (DL) based approaches have been proposed to alleviate the high cost of EL associated with the traditional models. Existing exploration of DL models for EL strictly follows the well-known twin-network architecture. However, we argue that the twin-network architecture is sub-optimal to EL, leading to inherent drawbacks of existing models. In order to address the drawbacks, we propose a novel and generic contrastive DL framework for EL. The proposed framework is able to capture both syntactic and semantic matching signals and pays attention to subtle but critical differences. Based on the framework, we develop a contrastive DL approach for EL, called CorDEL, with three powerful variants. We evaluate CorDEL with extensive experiments conducted on both public benchmark datasets and a real-world dataset. CorDEL outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 5.2%percent\\% on public benchmark datasets. Moreover, CorDEL yields a 2.4%percent\\% improvement over the current best DL model on the real-world dataset, while reducing the number of training parameters by 97.6%percent\\%.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
