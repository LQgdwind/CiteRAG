      "content": "Paper Title: Recent Trends in Artificial Intelligence-inspired Electronic Thermal Management\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The rise of computation-based methods in thermal management has gained immense attention in recent years due to the ability of deep learning to solve complex ‘physics’ problems, which are otherwise difficult to be approached using conventional techniques. Thermal management is required in electronic systems to keep them from overheating and burning, enhancing their efficiency and lifespan. For a long time, numerical techniques have been employed to aid in the thermal management of electronics. However, they come with some limitations. To increase the effectiveness of traditional numerical approaches and address the drawbacks faced in conventional approaches, researchers have looked at using artificial intelligence at various stages of the thermal management process. The present study discusses in detail, the current uses of deep learning in the domain of ‘electronic’ thermal management.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 53\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
