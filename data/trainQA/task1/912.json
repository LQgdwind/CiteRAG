Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Pre-training Polish Transformer-based Language Models at Scale\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Transformer-based language models are now widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This statement is especially true for English language, in which many pre-trained models utilizing transformer-based architecture have been published in recent years. This has driven forward the state of the art for a variety of standard NLP tasks such as classification, regression, and sequence labeling, as well as text-to-text tasks, such as machine translation, question answering, or summarization. The situation have been different for low-resource languages, such as Polish, however. Although some transformer-based language models for Polish are available, none of them have come close to the scale, in terms of corpus size and the number of parameters, of the largest English-language models. In this study, we present two language models for Polish based on the popular BERT architecture. The larger model was trained on a dataset consisting of over 1 billion polish sentences, or 135GB of raw text. We describe our methodology for collecting the data, preparing the corpus, and pre-training the model. We then evaluate our models on thirteen Polish linguistic tasks, and demonstrate improvements over previous approaches in eleven of them. Keywords Language Modeling ⋅⋅\\cdot Natural Language Processing\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
