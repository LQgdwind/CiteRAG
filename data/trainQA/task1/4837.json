      "content": "Paper Title: Data Fusion Challenges Privacy: What Can Privacy Regulation Do?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper focuses on some shortcomings in current privacy and data protection regulations’ ability to adequately address the ramifications of some AI-driven data processing practices, in particular where data sets are combined and processed by AI systems. The aim of this paper is twofold: We introduce a mathematical model, which demonstrates the exploitation of complex hidden correlations in seemingly uncorrelated variables through the merging of data sets. Secondly, we raise attention to two regulatory anomalies related to two fundamental assumptions underlying traditional privacy and data protection approaches: Assumption 1: Only Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Personal Data (PD) require privacy protection. Privacy and data protection regulations are only triggered with respect to PII/PD, but not anonymous data. This is not only problematic because determining whether data falls in the former or latter category is no longer straightforward, but also because privacy risks associated with data processing may exist whether or not an individual can be identified. Assumption 2: Given sufficient information provided in a transparent and understandable manner, individuals are able to adequately assess the privacy implications of their actions and protect their privacy interests. Through a review of interdisciplinary literature, we show that this assumption corresponds to the current societal consensus on privacy protection. However, relying on human privacy expectations fails to address some important privacy threats, because those expectations are increasingly at odds with the actual privacy implications of data processing practices, as most people lack the necessary technical literacy to understand the sophisticated technologies at play, not to mention correctly assess their privacy implications. To tackle these anomalies, we recommend regulatory reform in two directions: (1) Abolishing the distinction between personal and anonymized data for the purposes of triggering the application of privacy and data protection regulations and (2) developing methods to prioritize regulatory intervention based on the level of privacy risk posed by individual data processing actions. We are concerned with regulatory anomalies and potential solutions, rather than their implementation in specific legal regimes. This is an interdisciplinary paper that intends to build a bridge and facilitate coordination between the various communities involved in privacy research and policymaking.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
