Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 43 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Self-Labeling Refinement for Robust Representation Learning with Bootstrap Your Own Latent\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, we have worked towards two major goals. Firstly, we have investigated the importance of Batch Normalisation (BN) layers in a non-contrastive representation learning framework called Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL)[18]. We conducted several experiments to conclude that BN layers are not necessary for representation learning in BYOL [39]. Moreover, BYOL only learns from the positive pairs of images but ignore other semantically similar images in same input batch. For the second goal, we have introduced two new loss functions to determine the semantically similar pairs in the same input batch of images and reduce the distance between their representations. These loss functions are Cross-Cosine Similarity Loss (CCSL) and Cross-Sigmoid Similarity Loss (CSSL). Using the proposed loss functions, we are able to surpass the performance of Vanilla BYOL (71.04%) by training BYOL framework using CCSL loss (76.87%) on STL10 dataset. BYOL trained using CSSL loss performs comparably with Vanilla BYOL.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 43\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
