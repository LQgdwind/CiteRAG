Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sentence Semantic Regression for Text Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recall the classical text generation works, the generation framework can be briefly divided into two phases: idea reasoning and surface realization. The target of idea reasoning is to figure out the main idea which will be presented in the following talking/writing periods. Surface realization aims to arrange the most appropriate sentence to depict and convey the information distilled from the main idea. However, the current popular token-by-token text generation methods ignore this crucial process and suffer from many serious issues, such as idea/topic drift. To tackle the problems and realize this two-phase paradigm, we propose a new framework named Sentence Semantic Regression (SSR) based on sentence-level language modeling. For idea reasoning, two architectures SSR-AR and SSR-NonAR are designed to conduct sentence semantic regression autoregressively (like GPT2/3) and bidirectionally (like BERT). In the phase of surface realization, a mixed-granularity sentence decoder is designed to generate text with better consistency by jointly incorporating the predicted sentence-level main idea as well as the preceding contextual token-level information. We conduct experiments on four tasks of story ending prediction, story ending generation, dialogue generation, and sentence infilling. The results show that SSR can obtain better performance in terms of automatic metrics and human evaluation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
