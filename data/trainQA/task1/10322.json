Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Self-Labeling the Job Shop Scheduling Problem\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, we propose a Self-Supervised training strategy specifically designed for combinatorial problems. One of the main obstacles in applying supervised paradigms to such problems is the requirement of expensive target solutions as ground-truth, often produced with costly exact solvers. Inspired by Semi- and Self-Supervised learning, we show that it is possible to easily train generative models by sampling multiple solutions and using the best one according to the problem objective as a pseudo-label. In this way, we iteratively improve the model generation capability by relying only on its self-supervision, completely removing the need for optimality information. We prove the effectiveness of this Self-Labeling strategy on the Job Shop Scheduling (JSP), a complex combinatorial problem that is receiving much attention from the Reinforcement Learning community. We propose a generative model based on the well-known Pointer Network and train it with our strategy. Experiments on two popular benchmarks demonstrate the potential of this approach as the resulting models outperform constructive heuristics and current state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning proposals.000The code is available at: https://github.com/AndreaCorsini1/SelfLabelingJobShop\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 49\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
