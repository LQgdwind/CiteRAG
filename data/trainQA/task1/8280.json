Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Constructing Bayesian Pseudo-Coresets using Contrastive Divergence\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Bayesian Pseudo-Coreset (BPC) and Dataset Condensation are two parallel streams of work that construct a synthetic set such that, a model trained independently on this synthetic set, yields the same performance as training on the original training set. While dataset condensation methods use non-bayesian, heuristic ways to construct such a synthetic set, BPC methods take a bayesian approach and formulate the problem as divergence minimization between posteriors associated with original data and synthetic data. However, BPC methods generally rely on distributional assumptions on these posteriors which makes them less flexible and hinders their performance. In this work, we propose to solve these issues by modeling the posterior associated with synthetic data by an energy-based distribution. We derive a contrastive-divergence-like loss function to learn the synthetic set and show a simple and efficient way to estimate this loss. Further, we perform rigorous experiments pertaining to the proposed method. Our experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed method not only outperforms previous BPC methods but also gives performance comparable to dataset condensation counterparts.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
