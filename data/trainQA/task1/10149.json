Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Incorporating Geo-Diverse Knowledge into Prompting for Increased Geographical Robustness in Object Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Existing object recognition models have been shown to lack robustness in diverse geographical scenarios due to significant domain shifts in design and context. Class representations need to be adapted to more accurately reflect an object concept under these shifts. In the absence of training data from target geographies, we hypothesize that geography-specific descriptive knowledge of object categories can be leveraged to enhance robustness. For this purpose, we explore the feasibility of probing a large-language model for geography-specific object knowledge, and we investigate integrating knowledge in zero-shot and learnable soft prompting with the CLIP vision-language model. In particular, we propose a geography knowledge regularization method to ensure that soft prompts trained on a source set of geographies generalize to an unseen target set of geographies. Our gains on DollarStreet when generalizing from a model trained only on data from Europe are as large as +2.8 on countries from Africa, and +4.6 on the hardest classes. We further show competitive performance vs. few-shot target training, and provide insights into how descriptive knowledge captures geographical differences.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
