      "content": "Paper Title: Beyond Walking: A Large-Scale Image-Text Benchmark for Text-based Person Anomaly Search\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Text-based person search aims to retrieve specific individuals across camera networks using natural language descriptions. However, current benchmarks often exhibit biases towards common actions like walking or standing, neglecting the critical need for identifying abnormal behaviors in real-world scenarios. To meet such demands, we propose a new task, text-based person anomaly search, locating pedestrians engaged in both routine or anomalous activities via text. To enable the training and evaluation of this new task, we construct a large-scale image-text Pedestrian Anomaly Behavior (PAB) benchmark, featuring a broad spectrum of actions, e.g., running, performing, playing soccer, and the corresponding anomalies, e.g., lying, being hit, and falling of the same identity. The training set of PAB comprises 1,013,60510136051,013,605 synthesized image-text pairs of both normalities and anomalies, while the test set includes 1,97819781,978 real-world image-text pairs. To validate the potential of PAB, we introduce a cross-modal pose-aware framework, which integrates human pose patterns with identity-based hard negative pair sampling. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark show that synthetic training data facilitates the fine-grained behavior retrieval in the real-world test set, while the proposed pose-aware method further improves the recall@1 by 2.88%percent2.882.88\\%. We will release the dataset, code, and checkpoints to facilitate further research and ensure the reproducibility of our results.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
