Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Network Representation and Modular Decomposition of Combinatorial Structures: A Galled-Tree Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In phylogenetics, reconstructing rooted trees from distances between taxa is a common task. B√∂cker and Dress generalized this concept by introducing symbolic dated maps Œ¥:X√óX‚ÜíŒ•:ùõø‚ÜíùëãùëãŒ•\\delta\\colon X\\times X\\to\\Upsilon, where distances are replaced by symbols, and showed that there is a one-to-one correspondence between symbolic ultrametrics and labeled rooted phylogenetic trees. Many combinatorial structures fall under the umbrella of symbolic dated maps, such as 2-dissimilarities, symmetric labeled 2-structures, or edge-colored complete graphs, and are here referred to as strudigrams. Strudigrams have a unique decomposition into non-overlapping modules, which can be represented by a modular decomposition tree (MDT). In the absence of prime modules, strudigrams are equivalent to symbolic ultrametrics, and the MDT fully captures the relationships Œ¥‚Äã(x,y)ùõøùë•ùë¶\\delta(x,y) between pairs of vertices x,y‚ààXùë•ùë¶ùëãx,y\\in X through the label of their least common ancestor in the MDT. However, in the presence of prime vertices, this information is generally hidden. To provide this missing structural information, we aim to locally replace the prime vertices in the MDT to obtain networks that capture full information about the strudigrams. While starting with the general framework of prime-vertex replacement networks, we then focus on a specific type of such networks obtained by replacing prime vertices with so-called galls, resulting in labeled galled-trees. We introduce the concept of galled-tree explainable (GaTEx) strudigrams, provide their characterization, and demonstrate that recognizing these structures and reconstructing the labeled networks that explain them can be achieved in polynomial time.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
