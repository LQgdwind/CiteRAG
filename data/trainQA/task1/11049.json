Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: People Attribute Purpose to Autonomous Vehicles When Explaining Their Behavior\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A hallmark of a good XAI system is explanations that users can understand and act on. In many cases, this requires a system to offer causal or counterfactual explanations that are intelligible. Concepts and approaches from cognitive science can help us understand what kinds of explanations users might expect, and in which format (causal vs. counterfactual) to frame these explanations. We briefly review relevant literature from the cognitive science of explanation, particularly as it concerns teleology, the tendency to explain a decision in terms of the purpose it was meant to achieve. We then report empirical data on how people generate explanations for the behavior of autonomous vehicles, and how they evaluate these explanations. In a first survey, participants (n=54) were shown videos of a road scene and asked to generate either mechanistic, counterfactual, or teleological verbal explanations for a vehicle’s actions. In the second survey, a different set of participants (n=356) rated these explanations along various metrics including quality, trustworthiness, and how much each explanatory mode was emphasized in the explanation. Participants deemed mechanistic and teleological explanations as significantly higher quality than counterfactual explanations. In addition, perceived teleology was the best predictor of perceived quality and trustworthiness. Neither perceived teleology nor quality ratings were affected by whether the car whose actions were being explained was an autonomous vehicle or was being driven by a person. The results show people use and value teleological concepts to evaluate information about both other people and autonomous vehicles, indicating they find the ‘intentional stance’ a convenient abstraction. We make our dataset of annotated video situations with explanations, called Human Explanations for Autonomous Driving Decisions (HEADD), publicly available, which we hope will prompt further research on related questions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
