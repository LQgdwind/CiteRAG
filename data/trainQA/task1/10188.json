Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Racing From an AI Coach: Effects of Multimodal Autonomous Driving Explanations on Driving Performance, Cognitive Load, Expertise, and Trust\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In a pre-post experiment (n = 41), we test the impact of an AI Coach’s explanatory communications modeled after the instructions of human driving experts. Participants were divided into four (4) groups to assess two (2) dimensions of the AI coach’s explanations: information type (‘what’ and ‘why’-type explanations) and presentation modality (auditory and visual). We directly compare how AI Coaching sessions employing these techniques impact driving performance, cognitive load, confidence, expertise, and trust in an observation learning context. Through interviews, we delineate the learning process of our participants. Results show that an AI driving coach can be useful for teaching performance driving skills to novices. Comparing between groups, we find the type and modality of information influences performance outcomes. We attribute differences to how information directed attention, mitigated uncertainty, and influenced overload experienced by participants. These, in turn, affected how successfully participants were able to learn. Results suggest efficient, modality-appropriate explanations should be opted for when designing effective HMI communications that can instruct without overwhelming. Further, they support the need to align communications with human learning and cognitive processes. Results are synthesized into eight design implications for future autonomous vehicle HMI and AI coach design.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
