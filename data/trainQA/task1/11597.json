Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: KAN versus MLP on Irregular or Noisy Functions\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we compare the performance of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks on irregular or noisy functions. We control the number of parameters and the size of the training samples to ensure a fair comparison. For clarity, we categorize the functions into six types: regular functions, continuous functions with local non-differentiable points, functions with jump discontinuities, functions with singularities, functions with coherent oscillations, and noisy functions. Our experimental results indicate that KAN does not always perform best. For some types of functions, MLP outperforms or performs comparably to KAN. Furthermore, increasing the size of training samples can improve performance to some extent. When noise is added to functions, the irregular features are often obscured by the noise, making it challenging for both MLP and KAN to extract these features effectively. We hope these experiments provide valuable insights for future neural network research and encourage further investigations to overcome these challenges.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
