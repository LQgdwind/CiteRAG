Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Provable Multi-Party Reinforcement Learning with Diverse Human Feedback\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) is an emerging paradigm to align models with human preferences. Typically, RLHF aggregates preferences from multiple individuals who have diverse viewpoints that may conflict with each other. Our work initiates the theoretical study of multi-party RLHF that explicitly models the diverse preferences of multiple individuals. We show how traditional RLHF approaches can fail since learning a single reward function cannot capture and balance the preferences of multiple individuals. To overcome such limitations, we incorporate meta-learning to learn multiple preferences and adopt different social welfare functions to aggregate the preferences across multiple parties. We focus on the offline learning setting and establish sample complexity bounds, along with efficiency and fairness guarantees, for optimizing diverse social welfare functions such as Nash, Utilitarian, and Leximin welfare functions. Our results show a separation between the sample complexities of multi-party RLHF and traditional single-party RLHF. Furthermore, we consider a reward-free setting, where each individual‚Äôs preference is no longer consistent with a reward model, and give pessimistic variants of the von Neumann Winner based on offline preference data. Taken together, our work showcases the advantage of multi-party RLHF but also highlights its more demanding statistical complexity.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
