Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: High-Order Continuous Geometrical Validity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. We propose a conservative algorithm to test the geometrical validity of simplicial (triangles, tetrahedra), tensor product (quadrilaterals, hexahedra), and mixed (prisms) elements of arbitrary polynomial order as they deform over a piecewise-linear trajectory. Our algorithm uses a combination of adaptive Bézier refinement and bisection search to determine if, when, and where the Jacobian determinant of an element’s polynomial geometric map becomes negative in the transition from one configuration to another. In elastodynamic simulation, our algorithm guarantees that the system remains physically plausible during the entire trajectory, not only at discrete time steps. Unlike previous approaches, our method preserves its properties also when implemented using floating point arithmetic: This feature comes at a small additional runtime cost compared to existing inexact methods, making it a drop-in replacement for current validity tests, while providing superior robustness and generality. To prove the practical effectiveness of our algorithm, we demonstrate its use in a high-order Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) elastodynamic simulator, and we experimentally show that it prevents invalid, simulation-breaking configurations that would otherwise occur using inexact methods, without the need for manual parameter tuning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
