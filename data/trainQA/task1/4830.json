Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Deep metric learning improves lab of origin prediction of genetically engineered plasmids\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Genome engineering is undergoing unprecedented development and is now becoming widely available. To ensure responsible biotechnology innovation and to reduce misuse of engineered DNA sequences, it is vital to develop tools to identify the lab-of-origin of engineered plasmids. Genetic engineering attribution (GEA), the ability to make sequence-lab associations, would support forensic experts in this process. Here, we propose a method, based on metric learning, that ranks the most likely labs-of-origin whilst simultaneously generating embeddings for plasmid sequences and labs. These embeddings can be used to perform various downstream tasks, such as clustering DNA sequences and labs, as well as using them as features in machine learning models. Our approach employs a circular shift augmentation approach and is able to correctly rank the lab-of-origin 90%percent9090\\% of the time within its top 10 predictions - outperforming all current state-of-the-art approaches. We also demonstrate that we can perform few-shot-learning and obtain 76%percent7676\\% top-10 accuracy using only 10%percent1010\\% of the sequences. This means, we outperform the previous CNN approach using only one-tenth of the data. We also demonstrate that we are able to extract key signatures in plasmid sequences for particular labs, allowing for an interpretable examination of the modelâ€™s outputs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
