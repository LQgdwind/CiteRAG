Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 43 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Multi-View Textual-Visual Encoding: Towards One Hundred Thousand-Scale One-Shot Logo Identification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. In this paper, we study the problem of identifying logos of business brands in natural scenes in an open-set one-shot setting. This problem setup is significantly more challenging than traditionally-studied ‘closed-set’ and ‘large-scale training samples per category’ logo recognition settings. We propose a novel multi-view textual-visual encoding framework that encodes text appearing in the logos as well as the graphical design of the logos to learn robust contrastive representations. These representations are jointly learned for multiple views of logos over a batch and thereby they generalize well to unseen logos. We evaluate our proposed framework for cropped logo verification, cropped logo identification, and end-to-end logo identification in natural scene tasks; and compare it against state-of-the-art methods. Further, the literature lacks a ‘very-large-scale’ collection of reference logo images that can facilitate the study of one-hundred thousand-scale logo identification. To fill this gap in the literature, we introduce Wikidata Reference Logo Dataset (WiRLD), containing logos for 100K business brands harvested from Wikidata. Our proposed framework that achieves an area under the ROC curve of 91.3% on the QMUL-OpenLogo dataset for the verification task, outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 9.1% and 2.6% on the one-shot logo identification task on the Toplogos-10 and the FlickrLogos32 datasets, respectively. Further, we show that our method is more stable compared to other baselines even when the number of candidate logos is on a 100K scale.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 43\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
