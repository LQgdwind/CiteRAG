Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: SGDiff: A Style Guided Diffusion Model for Fashion Synthesis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. This paper reports on the development of a novel style guided diffusion model (SGDiff) which overcomes certain weaknesses inherent in existing models for image synthesis. The proposed SGDiff combines image modality with a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to facilitate creative fashion image synthesis. It addresses the limitations of text-to-image diffusion models by incorporating supplementary style guidance, substantially reducing training costs, and overcoming the difficulties of controlling synthesized styles with text-only inputs. This paper also introduces a new dataset â€“ SG-Fashion, specifically designed for fashion image synthesis applications, offering high-resolution images and an extensive range of garment categories. By means of comprehensive ablation study, we examine the application of classifier-free guidance to a variety of conditions and validate the effectiveness of the proposed model for generating fashion images of the desired categories, product attributes, and styles. The contributions of this paper include a novel classifier-free guidance method for multi-modal feature fusion, a comprehensive dataset for fashion image synthesis application, a thorough investigation on conditioned text-to-image synthesis, and valuable insights for future research in the text-to-image synthesis domain. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/taited/SGDiff.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
