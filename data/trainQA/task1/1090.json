Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: Enhancing Autonomy with Blockchain and Multi-Access Edge Computing in Distributed Robotic Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This conceptual paper discusses how different aspects involving the autonomous operation of robots and vehicles will change when they have access to next-generation mobile networks. 5G and beyond connectivity is bringing together a myriad of technologies and industries under its umbrella. High-bandwidth, low-latency edge computing services through network slicing have the potential to support novel application scenarios in different domains including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things. In particular, multi-tenant applications at the edge of the network will boost the development of autonomous robots and vehicles offering computational resources and intelligence through reliable offloading services. The integration of more distributed network architectures with distributed robotic systems can increase the degree of intelligence and level of autonomy of connected units. We argue that the last piece to put together a services framework with third-party integration will be next-generation low-latency blockchain networks. Blockchains will enable a transparent and secure way of providing services and managing resources at the Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) layer. We overview the state-of-the-art in MEC slicing, distributed robotic systems and blockchain technology to define a framework for services the MEC layer that will enhance the autonomous operations of connected robots and vehicles.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
