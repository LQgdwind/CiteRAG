Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Geometric Structure of Topic Models\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Topic models are a popular tool for clustering and analyzing textual data. They allow texts to be classified on the basis of their affiliation to the previously calculated topics. Despite their widespread use in research and application, an in-depth analysis of topic models is still an open research topic. State-of-the-art methods for interpreting topic models are based on simple visualizations, such as similarity matrices, top-term lists or embeddings, which are limited to a maximum of three dimensions. In this paper, we propose an incidence-geometric method for deriving an ordinal structure from flat topic models, such as non-negative matrix factorization. These enable the analysis of the topic model in a higher (order) dimension and the possibility of extracting conceptual relationships between several topics at once. Due to the use of conceptual scaling, our approach does not introduce any artificial topical relationships, such as artifacts of feature compression. Based on our findings, we present a new visualization paradigm for concept hierarchies based on ordinal motifs. These allow for a top-down view on topic spaces. We introduce and demonstrate the applicability of our approach based on a topic model derived from a corpus of scientific papers taken from 32 top machine learning venues.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 56\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
