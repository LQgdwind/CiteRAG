Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Scalable variable selection for two-view learning tasks with projection operators\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper we propose a novel variable selection method for two-view settings, or for vector-valued supervised learning problems. Our framework is able to handle extremely large scale selection tasks, where number of data samples could be even millions. In a nutshell, our method performs variable selection by iteratively selecting variables that are highly correlated with the output variables, but which are not correlated with the previously chosen variables. To measure the correlation, our method uses the concept of projection operators and their algebra. With the projection operators the relationship, correlation, between sets of input and output variables can also be expressed by kernel functions, thus nonlinear correlation models can be exploited as well. We experimentally validate our approach, showing on both synthetic and real data its scalability and the relevance of the selected features. Keywords: Supervised variable selection, vector-valued learning, projection-valued measure, reproducing kernel Hilbert space\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
