Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The rising growth of deep neural networks (DNNs) and datasets in size motivates the need for efficient solutions for simultaneous model selection and training. Many methods for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of iterative learners, including DNNs, attempt to solve this problem by querying and learning a response surface while searching for the optimum of that surface. However, many of these methods make myopic queries, do not consider prior knowledge about the response structure, and/or perform a biased cost-aware search, all of which exacerbate identifying the best-performing model when a total cost budget is specified. This paper proposes a novel approach referred to as Budget-Aware Planning for Iterative Learners (BAPI) to solve HPO problems under a constrained cost budget. BAPI is an efficient non-myopic Bayesian optimization solution that accounts for the budget and leverages the prior knowledge about the objective function and cost function to select better configurations and to take more informed decisions during the evaluation (training). Experiments on diverse HPO benchmarks for iterative learners show that BAPI performs better than state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
