      "content": "Paper Title: Sample complexity of hidden subgroup problem\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The hidden subgroup problem (𝖧𝖲𝖯𝖧𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{HSP}) has been attracting much attention in quantum computing, since several well-known quantum algorithms including Shor algorithm can be described in a uniform framework as quantum methods to address different instances of it. One of the central issues about 𝖧𝖲𝖯𝖧𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{HSP} is to characterize its quantum/classical complexity. For example, from the viewpoint of learning theory, sample complexity is a crucial concept. However, while the quantum sample complexity of the problem has been studied, a full characterization of the classical sample complexity of 𝖧𝖲𝖯𝖧𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{HSP} seems to be absent, which will thus be the topic in this paper. 𝖧𝖲𝖯𝖧𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{HSP} over a finite group is defined as follows: For a finite group G𝐺G and a finite set V𝑉V, given a function f:G→V:𝑓→𝐺𝑉f:G\\to V and the promise that for any x,y∈G,f​(x)=f​(x​y)formulae-sequence𝑥𝑦𝐺𝑓𝑥𝑓𝑥𝑦x,y\\in G,f(x)=f(xy) iff y∈H𝑦𝐻y\\in H for a subgroup H∈ℋ𝐻ℋH\\in\\mathcal{H}, where ℋℋ\\mathcal{H} is a set of candidate subgroups of G𝐺G, the goal is to identify H𝐻H. Our contributions are as follows: i) For 𝖧𝖲𝖯𝖧𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{HSP}, we show that the number of uniform examples necessary to learn the hidden subgroup with bounded error is at least Ω​(max⁡{minH∈ℋ⁡log⁡|ℋ|log⁡|G||H|,minH∈ℋ⁡|G||H|​log⁡|ℋ|log⁡|G||H|})Ωsubscript𝐻ℋℋ𝐺𝐻subscript𝐻ℋ𝐺𝐻ℋ𝐺𝐻\\Omega\\left(\\max\\left\\{\\min\\limits_{H\\in\\mathcal{H}}\\frac{\\log|\\mathcal{H}|}{\\log\\frac{|G|}{|H|}},\\min\\limits_{H\\in\\mathcal{H}}\\sqrt{\\frac{|G|}{|H|}\\frac{\\log|\\mathcal{H}|}{\\log\\frac{|G|}{|H|}}}\\right\\}\\right), and on the other hand, O​(maxH∈ℋ⁡{s​r​(ℋ),|G||H|​s​r​(ℋ)})𝑂subscript𝐻ℋ𝑠𝑟ℋ𝐺𝐻𝑠𝑟ℋO\\left(\\max\\limits_{H\\in\\mathcal{H}}\\left\\{sr(\\mathcal{H}),\\sqrt{\\frac{|G|}{|H|}sr(\\mathcal{H})}\\right\\}\\right) uniform examples are sufficient, where s​r​(ℋ)=maxH∈ℋ⁡𝗋​(H)𝑠𝑟ℋsubscript𝐻ℋ𝗋𝐻sr(\\mathcal{H})=\\max\\limits_{H\\in\\mathcal{H}}\\mathsf{r}(H) and 𝗋​(H)𝗋𝐻\\mathsf{r}(H) is the rank of H𝐻H. ii) By concretizing the parameters of 𝖧𝖲𝖯𝖧𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{HSP}, we consider a class of restricted Abelian hidden subgroup problem (𝗋𝖠𝖧𝖲𝖯𝗋𝖠𝖧𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{rAHSP}) and obtain the upper and lower bounds for the sample complexity of 𝗋𝖠𝖧𝖲𝖯𝗋𝖠𝖧𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{rAHSP}. iii) We continue to discuss a special case of 𝗋𝖠𝖧𝖲𝖯𝗋𝖠𝖧𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{rAHSP}, generalized Simon’s problem (𝖦𝖲𝖯𝖦𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{GSP}), and show that the sample complexity of 𝖦𝖲𝖯𝖦𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{GSP} is Θ​(max⁡{k,k⋅pn−k})Θ𝑘⋅𝑘superscript𝑝𝑛𝑘\\Theta\\left(\\max\\left\\{k,\\sqrt{k\\cdot p^{n-k}}\\right\\}\\right). Thus we obtain a complete characterization of the sample complexity of 𝖦𝖲𝖯𝖦𝖲𝖯\\mathsf{GSP}.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
