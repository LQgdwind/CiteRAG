      "content": "Paper Title: Facilitating Contrastive Learning of Discourse Relational Senses by Exploiting the Hierarchy of Sense Relations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Implicit discourse relation recognition is a challenging task that involves identifying the sense or senses that hold between two adjacent spans of text, in the absence of an explicit connective between them. In both PDTB-2 Prasad et al. (2008) and PDTB-3 Webber et al. (2019), discourse relational senses are organized into a three-level hierarchy ranging from four broad top-level senses, to more specific senses below them. Most previous work on implicit discourse relation recognition have used the sense hierarchy simply to indicate what sense labels were available. Here we do more â€” incorporating the sense hierarchy into the recognition process itself and using it to select the negative examples used in contrastive learning. With no additional effort, the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the task. Our code is released in https://github.com/wanqiulong 0923/Contrastive_IDRR.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 57\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
