Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Network Analysis Using Zigzag Persistence\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This work presents a framework for studying temporal networks using zigzag persistence, a tool from the field of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). The resulting approach is general and applicable to a wide variety of time-varying graphs. For example, these graphs may correspond to a system modeled as a network with edges whose weights are functions of time, or they may represent a time series of a complex dynamical system. We use simplicial complexes to represent snapshots of the temporal networks that can then be analyzed using zigzag persistence. We show two applications of our method to dynamic networks: an analysis of commuting trends on multiple temporal scales, e.g., daily and weekly, in the Great Britain transportation network, and the detection of periodic/chaotic transitions due to intermittency in dynamical systems represented by temporal ordinal partition networks. Our findings show that the resulting zero- and one-dimensional zigzag persistence diagrams can detect changes in the networks’ shapes that are missed by traditional connectivity and centrality graph statistics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
