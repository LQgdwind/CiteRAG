Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Unsupervised Evaluation of Out-of-distribution Detection: A Data-centric Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods assume that they have test ground truths, i.e., whether individual test samples are in-distribution (IND) or OOD. However, in the real world, we do not always have such ground truths, and thus do not know which sample is correctly detected and cannot compute the metric like AUROC to evaluate the performance of different OOD detection methods. In this paper, we are the first to introduce the unsupervised evaluation problem in OOD detection, which aims to evaluate OOD detection methods in real-world changing environments without OOD labels. We propose three methods to compute Gscore as an unsupervised indicator of OOD detection performance. We further introduce a new benchmark Gbench, which has 200 real-world OOD datasets of various label spaces to train and evaluate our method. Through experiments, we find a strong quantitative correlation between Gscore and the OOD detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Gscore achieves state-of-the-art performance. Gscore also generalizes well with different IND/OOD datasets, OOD detection methods, backbones and dataset sizes. We further provide interesting analyses of the effects of backbones and IND/OOD datasets on OOD detection performance. The data and code will be available.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
