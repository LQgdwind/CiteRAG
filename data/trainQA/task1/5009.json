Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Calorie Aware Automatic Meal Kit Generation from an Image\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Calorie and nutrition research has attained increased interest in recent years. But, due to the complexity of the problem, literature in this area focuses on a limited subset of ingredients or dish types and simple convolutional neural networks or traditional machine learning. Simultaneously, estimation of ingredient portions can help improve calorie estimation and meal re-production from a given image. In this paper, given a single cooking image, a pipeline for calorie estimation and meal re-production for different servings of the meal is proposed. The pipeline contains two stages. In the first stage, a set of ingredients associated with the meal in the given image are predicted. In the second stage, given image features and ingredients, portions of the ingredients and finally the total meal calorie are simultaneously estimated using a deep transformer based model. Portion estimation introduced in the model helps improve the calorie estimation and is also beneficial for meal re-production in different serving sizes. To demonstrate the benefits of the pipeline, the model can be used for meal kits generation. To evaluate the pipeline, the large scale dataset Recipe1M is used. Prior to experiments, the Recipe1M dataset is parsed and explicitly annotated with portions of ingredients. Experiments show that using ingredients and their portions significantly improves calorie estimation. Also, a visual interface is created in which a user can interact with the pipeline to reach accurate calorie estimations and generate a meal kit for cooking purposes.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
