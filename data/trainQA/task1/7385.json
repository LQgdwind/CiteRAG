Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Generalizable Graph Contrastive Learning: An Information Theory Perspective\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph contrastive learning (GCL) emerges as the most representative approach for graph representation learning, which leverages the principle of maximizing mutual information (InfoMax) to learn node representations applied in downstream tasks. To explore better generalization from GCL to downstream tasks, previous methods heuristically define data augmentation or pretext tasks. However, the generalization ability of GCL and its theoretical principle are still less reported. In this paper, we first propose a metric named GCL-GE for GCL generalization ability. Considering the intractability of the metric due to the agnostic downstream task, we theoretically prove a mutual information upper bound for it from an information-theoretic perspective. Guided by the bound, we design a GCL framework named InfoAdv with enhanced generalization ability, which jointly optimizes the generalization metric and InfoMax to strike the right balance between pretext task fitting and the generalization ability on downstream tasks. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of representative benchmarks, and experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
