Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Practical Edge Detection via Robust Collaborative Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Edge detection, as a core component in a wide range of vision-oriented tasks, is to identify object boundaries and prominent edges in natural images. An edge detector is desired to be both efficient and accurate for practical use. To achieve the goal, two key issues should be concerned: 1) How to liberate deep edge models from inefficient pre-trained backbones that are leveraged by most existing deep learning methods, for saving the computational cost and cutting the model size; and 2) How to mitigate the negative influence from noisy or even wrong labels in training data, which widely exist in edge detection due to the subjectivity and ambiguity of annotators, for the robustness and accuracy. In this paper, we attempt to simultaneously address the above problems via developing a collaborative learning based model, termed PEdger. The principle behind our PEdger is that, the information learned from different training moments and heterogeneous (recurrent and non recurrent in this work) architectures, can be assembled to explore robust knowledge against noisy annotations, even without the help of pre-training on extra data. Extensive ablation studies together with quantitative and qualitative experimental comparisons on the BSDS500 and NYUD datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our design, and demonstrate its superiority over other competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and model size. Codes can be found at https://github.com/ForawardStar/PEdger.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 51\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
