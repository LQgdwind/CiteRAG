Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Data Dimension Reduction makes ML Algorithms efficient\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Data dimension reduction (DDR) is all about mapping data from high dimensions to low dimensions, various techniques of DDR are being used for image dimension reduction like Random Projections, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the Variance approach, LSA-Transform, the Combined and Direct approaches, and the New Random Approach. Auto-encoders (AE) are used to learn end-to-end mapping. In this paper, we demonstrate that pre-processing not only speeds up the algorithms but also improves accuracy in both supervised and unsupervised learning. In pre-processing of DDR, first PCA based DDR is used for supervised learning, then we explore AE based DDR for unsupervised learning. In PCA based DDR, we first compare supervised learning algorithms accuracy and time before and after applying PCA. Similarly, in AE based DDR, we compare unsupervised learning algorithm accuracy and time before and after AE representation learning. Supervised learning algorithms including support-vector machines (SVM), Decision Tree with GINI index, Decision Tree with entropy and Stochastic Gradient Descent classifier (SGDC) and unsupervised learning algorithm including K-means clustering, are used for classification purpose. We used two datasets MNIST and FashionMNIST Our experiment shows that there is massive improvement in accuracy and time reduction after pre-processing in both supervised and unsupervised learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
