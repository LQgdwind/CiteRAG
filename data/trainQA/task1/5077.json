Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Neural Piecewise-Constant Delay Differential Equations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Continuous-depth neural networks, such as the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), have aroused a great deal of interest from the communities of machine learning and data science in recent years, which bridge the connection between deep neural networks and dynamical systems. In this article, we introduce a new sort of continuous-depth neural network, called the Neural Piecewise-Constant Delay Differential Equations (PCDDEs). Here, unlike the recently proposed framework of the Neural Delay Differential Equations (DDEs), we transform the single delay into the piecewise-constant delay(s). The Neural PCDDEs with such a transformation, on one hand, inherit the strength of universal approximating capability in Neural DDEs. On the other hand, the Neural PCDDEs, leveraging the contributions of the information from the multiple previous time steps, further promote the modeling capability without augmenting the network dimension. With such a promotion, we show that the Neural PCDDEs do outperform the several existing continuous-depth neural frameworks on the one-dimensional piecewise-constant delay population dynamics and real-world datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
