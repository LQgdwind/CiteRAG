Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Network-Aware Optimization of Distributed Learning for Fog Computing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Fog computing promises to enable machine learning tasks to scale to large amounts of data by distributing processing across connected devices. Two key challenges to achieving this goal are (i) heterogeneity in devicesâ€™ compute resources and (ii) topology constraints on which devices communicate with each other. We address these challenges by developing a novel network-aware distributed learning methodology where devices optimally share local data processing and send their learnt parameters to a server for periodic aggregation. Unlike traditional federated learning, our method enables devices to offload their data processing tasks to each other, with these decisions optimized to trade off costs associated with data processing, offloading, and discarding. We analytically characterize the optimal data transfer solution under different assumptions on the fog network scenario, showing for example that the value of offloading is approximately linear in the range of computing costs in the network when the cost of discarding is modeled as decreasing linearly in the amount of data processed at each node. Our experiments on real-world data traces from our testbed confirm that our algorithms improve network resource utilization substantially without sacrificing the accuracy of the learned model, for varying distributions of data across devices. We also investigate the effect of network dynamics on model learning and resource costs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
