      "content": "Paper Title: Minimum Stable Cut and Treewidth\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A stable or locally-optimal cut of a graph is a cut whose weight cannot be increased by changing the side of a single vertex. Equivalently, a cut is stable if all vertices have the (weighted) majority of their neighbors on the other side. Finding a stable cut is a prototypical PLS-complete problem that has been studied in the context of local search and of algorithmic game theory. In this paper we study Min Stable Cut, the problem of finding a stable cut of minimum weight, which is closely related to the Price of Anarchy of the Max Cut game. Since this problem is NP-hard, we study its complexity on graphs of low treewidth, low degree, or both. We begin by showing that the problem remains weakly NP-hard on severely restricted trees, so bounding treewidth alone cannot make it tractable. We match this hardness with a pseudo-polynomial DP algorithm solving the problem in time (Δ⋅W)O​(tw)​nO​(1)superscript⋅Δ𝑊𝑂twsuperscript𝑛𝑂1(\\Delta\\cdot W)^{O(\\mathrm{tw})}n^{O(1)}, where twtw\\mathrm{tw} is the treewidth, ΔΔ\\Delta the maximum degree, and W𝑊W the maximum weight. On the other hand, bounding ΔΔ\\Delta is also not enough, as the problem is NP-hard for unweighted graphs of bounded degree. We therefore parameterize Min Stable Cut by both twtw\\mathrm{tw} and ΔΔ\\Delta and obtain an FPT algorithm running in time 2O​(Δ​tw)​(n+log⁡W)O​(1)superscript2𝑂Δtwsuperscript𝑛𝑊𝑂12^{O(\\Delta\\mathrm{tw})}(n+\\log W)^{O(1)}. Our main result for the weighted problem is to provide a reduction showing that both aforementioned algorithms are essentially optimal, even if we replace treewidth by pathwidth: if there exists an algorithm running in (n​W)o​(pw)superscript𝑛𝑊𝑜pw(nW)^{o(\\mathrm{pw})} or 2o​(Δ​pw)​(n+log⁡W)O​(1)superscript2𝑜Δpwsuperscript𝑛𝑊𝑂12^{o(\\Delta\\mathrm{pw})}(n+\\log W)^{O(1)}, then the ETH is false. Complementing this, we show that we can, however, obtain an FPT approximation scheme parameterized by treewidth, if we consider almost-stable solutions, that is, solutions where no single vertex can unilaterally increase the weight of its incident cut edges by more than a factor of (1+ε)1𝜀(1+\\varepsilon). Motivated by these mostly negative results, we consider Unweighted Min Stable Cut. Here our results already imply a much faster exact algorithm running in time ΔO​(tw)​nO​(1)superscriptΔ𝑂twsuperscript𝑛𝑂1\\Delta^{O(\\mathrm{tw})}n^{O(1)}. We show that this is also probably essentially optimal: an algorithm running in no​(pw)superscript𝑛𝑜pwn^{o(\\mathrm{pw})} would contradict the ETH.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
