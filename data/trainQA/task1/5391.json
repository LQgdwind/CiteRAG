      "content": "Paper Title: Computing list homomorphisms in geometric intersection graphs\n\nPaper Abstract: A homomorphism from a graph G𝐺G to a graph H𝐻H is an edge-preserving mapping from V​(G)𝑉𝐺V(G) to V​(H)𝑉𝐻V(H). Let H𝐻H be a fixed graph with possible loops. In the list homomorphism problem, denoted by LHom(H𝐻H), the instance is a graph G𝐺G, whose every vertex is equipped with a subset of V​(H)𝑉𝐻V(H), called list. We ask whether there exists a homomorphism from G𝐺G to H𝐻H, such that every vertex from G𝐺G is mapped to a vertex from its list. We study the complexity of the LHom(H𝐻H) problem in intersection graphs of various geometric objects. In particular, we are interested in answering the question for what graphs H𝐻H and for what types of geometric objects, the LHom(H𝐻H) problem can be solved in time subexponential in the number of vertices of the instance. We fully resolve this question for string graphs, i.e., intersection graphs of continuous curves in the plane. Quite surprisingly, it turns out that the dichotomy exactly coincides with the analogous dichotomy for graphs excluding a fixed path as an induced subgraph [Okrasa, Rzążewski, STACS 2021]. Then we turn our attention to subclasses of string graphs, defined as intersections of fat objects. We observe that the (non)existence of subexponential-time algorithms in such classes is closely related to the size mrc​(H)mrc𝐻\\mathrm{mrc}(H) of a maximum reflexive clique in H𝐻H, i.e., maximum number of pairwise adjacent vertices, each of which has a loop. We study the maximum value of mrc​(H)mrc𝐻\\mathrm{mrc}(H) that guarantees the existence of a subexponential-time algorithm for LHom(H𝐻H) in intersection graphs of (i) convex fat objects, (ii) fat similarly-sized objects, and (iii) disks. In the first two cases we obtain optimal results, by giving matching algorithms and lower bounds. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of our results to weighted generalizations of LHom(H𝐻H).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
