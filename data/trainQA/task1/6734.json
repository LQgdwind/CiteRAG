Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Unit-length Rectangular Drawings of GraphsThis research was partially supported by MIUR Project ‚ÄúAHeAD‚Äù under PRIN 20174LF3T8, and by H2020-MSCA-RISE project 734922 ‚Äì ‚ÄúCONNECT‚Äù.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A rectangular drawing of a planar graph Gùê∫G is a planar drawing of Gùê∫G in which vertices are mapped to grid points, edges are mapped to horizontal and vertical straight-line segments, and faces are drawn as rectangles. Sometimes this latter constraint is relaxed for the outer face. In this paper, we study rectangular drawings in which the edges have unit length. We show a complexity dichotomy for the problem of deciding the existence of a unit-length rectangular drawing, depending on whether the outer face must also be drawn as a rectangle or not. Specifically, we prove that the problem is \\NP-complete for biconnected graphs when the drawing of the outer face is not required to be a rectangle, even if the sought drawing must respect a given planar embedding, whereas it is polynomial-time solvable, both in the fixed and the variable embedding settings, if the outer face is required to be drawn as a rectangle.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
