Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Autoencoder-based General Purpose Representation Learning for Customer Embedding\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recent years, exploiting the domain-specific underlying structure of data and its generative factors for representation learning has shown success in various use-case agnostic applications. However, the diversity and complexity of tabular data have made it challenging to represent these structures in a latent space through multi-dimensional vectors. We design an autoencoder-based framework for building general purpose embeddings, we assess the performance of different autoencoder architectures, and show simpler models outperform complex ones in embedding highly complex tabular data. We apply our framework to produce plug-and-play, rich, and anonymized embeddings representing AWS customers for usage in any model, saving up to 45% of development time, and observe significant improvements in downstream models. Moreover, we propose a significant improvement to the calculation of reconstruction loss for multi-layer contractive autoencoders (CAE) by calculating the Jacobian of the entire encoder leading to a 15% improvement in reconstruction quality when compared to a stacked CAE.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
