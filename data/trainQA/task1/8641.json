Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Metric Tools for Sensitivity Analysis with Applications to Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract As Machine Learning models are considered for autonomous decisions with significant social impact, the need for understanding how these models work rises rapidly. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to provide interpretations for predictions made by Machine Learning models, in order to make the model trustworthy and more transparent for the user. For example, selecting relevant input variables for the problem directly impacts the model‚Äôs ability to learn and make accurate predictions, so obtaining information about input importance play a crucial role when training the model. One of the main XAI techniques to obtain input variable importance is the sensitivity analysis based on partial derivatives. However, existing literature of this method provide no justification of the aggregation metrics used to retrieved information from the partial derivatives. In this paper, a theoretical framework is proposed to study sensitivities of ML models using metric techniques. From this metric interpretation, a complete family of new quantitative metrics called Œ±ùõº\\alpha-curves is extracted. These Œ±ùõº\\alpha-curves provide information with greater depth on the importance of the input variables for a machine learning model than existing XAI methods in the literature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Œ±ùõº\\alpha-curves using synthetic and real datasets, comparing the results against other XAI methods for variable importance and validating the analysis results with the ground truth or literature information.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
