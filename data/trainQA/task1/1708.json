Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Discovery Data Topology with the Closure Structure. Theoretical and practical aspects\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we are revisiting pattern mining and especially itemset mining, which allows one to analyze binary datasets in searching for interesting and meaningful association rules and respective itemsets in an unsupervised way. While a summarization of a dataset based on a set of patterns does not provide a general and satisfying view over a dataset, we introduce a concise representation –the closure structure– based on closed itemsets and their minimum generators, for capturing the intrinsic content of a dataset. The closure structure allows one to understand the topology of the dataset in the whole and the inherent complexity of the data. We propose a formalization of the closure structure in terms of Formal Concept Analysis, which is well adapted to study this data topology. We present and demonstrate theoretical results, and as well, practical results using the GDPM algorithm. GDPM is rather unique in its functionality as it returns a characterization of the topology of a dataset in terms of complexity levels, highlighting the diversity and the distribution of the itemsets. Finally a series of experiments shows how GDPM can be practically used and what can be expected from the output.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
