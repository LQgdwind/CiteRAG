Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: EXPLOITING CROSS DOMAIN ACOUSTIC-TO-ARTICULATORY INVERTED FEATURES FOR DISORDERED SPEECH RECOGNITION\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Articulatory features are inherently invariant to acoustic signal distortion and have been successfully incorporated into automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for normal speech. Their practical application to disordered speech recognition is often limited by the difficulty in collecting such specialist data from impaired speakers. This paper presents a cross-domain acoustic-to-articulatory (A2A) inversion approach that utilizes the parallel acoustic-articulatory data of the 15-hour TORGO corpus in model training before being cross-domain adapted to the 102.7-hour UASpeech corpus and to produce articulatory features. Mixture density networks based neural A2A inversion models were used. A cross-domain feature adaptation network was also used to reduce the acoustic mismatch between the TORGO and UASpeech data. On both tasks, incorporating the A2A generated articulatory features consistently outperformed the baseline hybrid DNN/TDNN, CTC and Conformer based end-to-end systems constructed using acoustic features only. The best multi-modal system incorporating video modality and the cross-domain articulatory features as well as data augmentation and learning hidden unit contributions (LHUC) speaker adaptation produced the lowest published word error rate (WER) of 24.82% on the 16 dysarthric speakers of the benchmark UASpeech task.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
