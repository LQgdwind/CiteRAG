Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Meta-learning for Matrix Factorization without Shared Rows or Columns\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We propose a method that meta-learns a knowledge on matrix factorization from various matrices, and uses the knowledge for factorizing unseen matrices. The proposed method uses a neural network that takes a matrix as input, and generates prior distributions of factorized matrices of the given matrix. The neural network is meta-learned such that the expected imputation error is minimized when the factorized matrices are adapted to each matrix by a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We use a gradient descent method for the MAP estimation, which enables us to backpropagate the expected imputation error through the gradient descent steps for updating neural network parameters since each gradient descent step is written in a closed form and is differentiable. The proposed method can meta-learn from matrices even when their rows and columns are not shared, and their sizes are different from each other. In our experiments with three user-item rating datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method can impute the missing values from a limited number of observations in unseen matrices after being trained with different matrices.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
