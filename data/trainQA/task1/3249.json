Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 56 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Federated Multi-View Learning for Private Medical Data Integration and Analysis\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Along with the rapid expansion of information technology and digitalization of health data, there is an increasing concern on maintaining data privacy while garnering the benefits in medical field. Two critical challenges are identified: Firstly, medical data is naturally distributed across multiple local sites, making it difficult to collectively train machine learning models without data leakage. Secondly, in medical applications, data are often collected from different sources and views, resulting in heterogeneity and complexity that requires reconciliation. This paper aims to provide a generic Federated Multi-View Learning (FedMV) framework for multi-view data leakage prevention, which is based on different types of local data availability and enables to accommodate two types of problems: Vertical Federated Multi-View Learning (V-FedMV) and Horizontal Federated Multi-View Learning (H-FedMV). We experimented with real-world keyboard data collected from BiAffect study. The results demonstrated that the proposed FedMV approach can make full use of multi-view data in a privacy-preserving way, and both V-FedMV and H-FedMV methods perform better than their single-view and pairwise counterparts. Besides, the proposed model can be easily adapted to deal with multi-view sequential data in a federated environment, which has been modeled and experimentally studied. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first to consider both vertical and horizontal diversification in the multi-view setting，as well as their sequential federated learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 56\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
