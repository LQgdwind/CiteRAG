Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Explainable Image Classification with Evidence Counterfactual\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The complexity of state-of-the-art modeling techniques for image classification impedes the ability to explain model predictions in an interpretable way. Existing explanation methods generally create importance rankings in terms of pixels or pixel groups. However, the resulting explanations lack an optimal size, do not consider feature dependence and are only related to one class. Counterfactual explanation methods are considered promising to explain complex model decisions, since they are associated with a high degree of human interpretability. In this paper, SEDC is introduced as a model-agnostic instance-level explanation method for image classification to obtain visual counterfactual explanations. For a given image, SEDC searches a small set of segments that, in case of removal, alters the classification. As image classification tasks are typically multiclass problems, SEDC-T is proposed as an alternative method that allows specifying a target counterfactual class. We compare SEDC(-T) with popular feature importance methods such as LRP, LIME and SHAP, and we describe how the mentioned importance ranking issues are addressed. Moreover, concrete examples and experiments illustrate the potential of our approach (1) to obtain trust and insight, and (2) to obtain input for model improvement by explaining misclassifications.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
