Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Dynamic Multi-Robot Task Allocation under Uncertainty and Temporal Constraints\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the problem of dynamically allocating tasks to multiple agents under time window constraints and task completion uncertainty. Our objective is to minimize the number of unsuccessful tasks at the end of the operation horizon. We present a multi-robot allocation algorithm that decouples the key computational challenges of sequential decision-making under uncertainty and multi-agent coordination and addresses them in a hierarchical manner. The lower layer computes policies for individual agents using dynamic programming with tree search, and the upper layer resolves conflicts in individual plans to obtain a valid multi-agent allocation. Our algorithm, Stochastic Conflict-Based Allocation (SCoBA), is optimal in expectation and complete under some reasonable assumptions. In practice, SCoBA is computationally efficient enough to interleave planning and execution online. On the metric of successful task completion, SCoBA consistently outperforms a number of baseline methods and shows strong competitive performance against an oracle with complete lookahead. It also scales well with the number of tasks and agents. We validate our results over a wide range of simulations on two distinct domains: multi-arm conveyor belt pick-and-place and multi-drone delivery dispatch in a city.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
