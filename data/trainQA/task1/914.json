Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Condition Numbers for the Cube. I: Univariate Polynomials and Hypersurfaces\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The condition-based complexity analysis framework is one of the gems of modern numerical algebraic geometry and theoretical computer science. Amond the challenges that it poses is to expand the currently limited range of random polynomials that we can handle. Despite important recent progress, the available tools cannot handle random sparse polynomials and Gaussian polynomials, that is polynomials whose coefficients are i.i.d. Gaussian random variables. We initiate a condition-based complexity framework based on the norm of the cube that is a step in this direction. We present this framework for real hypersurfaces and univariate polynomials. We demonstrate its capabilities in two problems, under very mild probabilistic assumptions. On the one hand, we show that the average run-time of the Plantinga-Vegter algorithm is polynomial in the degree for random sparse (alas a restricted sparseness structure) polynomials and random Gaussian polynomials. On the other hand, we study the size of the subdivision tree for Descartes’ solver and run-time of the solver by Jindal and Sagraloff (2017). In both cases, we provide a bound that is polynomial in the size of the input (size of the support plus the logarithm of the degree) not only for the average but also for all higher moments.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper.
