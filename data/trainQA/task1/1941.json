Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 57 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Predicting and Explaining Vehicle Fuel Consumption Anomalies\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Identifying anomalies in the fuel consumption of the vehicles of a fleet is a crucial aspect for optimizing consumption and reduce costs. However, this information alone is insufficient, since fleet operators need to know the causes behind anomalous fuel consumption. We combine unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, domain knowledge and interpretable Machine Learning models for explaining potential causes of abnormal fuel consumption in terms of feature relevance. The explanations are used for generating recommendations about fuel optimization, that are adjusted according to two different user profiles: fleet managers and fleet operators. Results are evaluated over real-world data from telematics devices connected to diesel and petrol vehicles from different types of industrial fleets. We measure the proposal regarding model performance, and using Explainable AI metrics that compare the explanations in terms of representativeness, fidelity, stability, contrastiveness and consistency with apriori beliefs. The potential fuel reductions that can be achieved is round 35%.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper.
