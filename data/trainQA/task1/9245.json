Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data.

      "content": "Paper Title: Quantifying Node-based Core Resilience\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Core decomposition is an efficient building block for various graph analysis tasks such as dense subgraph discovery and identifying influential nodes. One crucial weakness of the core decomposition is its sensitivity to changes in the graph: inserting or removing a few edges can drastically change the core structure of a graph. Hence, it is essential to characterize, quantify, and, if possible, improve the resilience of the core structure of a given graph in global and local levels. Previous works mostly considered the core resilience of the entire graph or important subgraphs in it. In this work, we study node-based core resilience measures upon edge removals and insertions. We first show that a previously proposed measure, Core Strength, does not correctly capture the core resilience of a node upon edge removals. Next, we introduce the concept of dependency graph to capture the impact of neighbor nodes (for edge removal) and probable future neighbor nodes (for edge insertion) on the core number of a given node. Accordingly, we define Removal Strength and Insertion Strength measures to capture the resilience of an individual node upon removing and inserting an edge, respectively. As naive computation of those measures is costly, we provide efficient heuristics built on key observations about the core structure. We consider two key applications, finding critical edges and identifying influential spreaders, to demonstrate the usefulness of our new measures on various real-world networks and against several baselines. We also show that our heuristic algorithms are more efficient than the naive approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
