Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning to Help Emergency Vehicles Arrive Faster: A Cooperative Vehicle-Road Scheduling Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The ever-increasing heavy traffic congestion potentially impedes the accessibility of emergency vehicles (EVs), resulting in detrimental impacts on critical services and even safety of people‚Äôs lives. Hence, it is significant to propose an efficient scheduling approach to help EVs arrive faster. Existing vehicle-centric scheduling approaches aim to recommend the optimal paths for EVs based on the current traffic status while the road-centric scheduling approaches aim to improve the traffic condition and assign a higher priority for EVs to pass an intersection. With the intuition that real-time vehicle-road information interaction and strategy coordination can bring more benefits, we propose LEVID, a LEarning-based cooperative VehIcle-roaD scheduling approach including a real-time route planning module and a collaborative traffic signal control module, which interact with each other and make decisions iteratively. The real-time route planning module adapts the artificial potential field method to address the real-time changes of traffic signals and avoid falling into a local optimum. The collaborative traffic signal control module leverages a graph attention reinforcement learning framework to extract the latent features of different intersections and abstract their interplay to learn cooperative policies. Extensive experiments based on multiple real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
