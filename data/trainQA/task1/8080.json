Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: HyperAttack: Multi-Gradient-Guided White-box Adversarial Structure Attack of Hypergraph Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Hypergraph neural networks (HGNN) have shown superior performance in various deep learning tasks, leveraging the high-order representation ability to formulate complex correlations among data by connecting two or more nodes through hyperedge modeling. Despite the well-studied adversarial attacks on Graph Neural Networks (GNN), there is few study on adversarial attacks against HGNN, which leads to a threat to the safety of HGNN applications. In this paper, we introduce HyperAttack, the first white-box adversarial attack framework against hypergraph neural networks. HyperAttack conducts a white-box structure attack by perturbing hyperedge link status towards the target node with the guidance of both gradients and integrated gradients. We evaluate HyperAttack on the widely-used Cora and PubMed datasets and three hypergraph neural networks with typical hypergraph modeling techniques. Compared to state-of-the-art white-box structural attack methods for GNN, HyperAttack achieves a 10â€“20X improvement in time efficiency while also increasing attack success rates by 1.3%percent\\%-3.7%percent\\%. The results show that HyperAttack can achieve efficient adversarial attacks that balance effectiveness and time costs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
