Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 61 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Interacting with next-phrase suggestions: How suggestion systems aid and influence the cognitive processes of writing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Writing with next-phrase suggestions powered by large language models is becoming more pervasive by the day. However, research to understand writers’ interaction and decision-making processes while engaging with such systems is still emerging. We conducted a qualitative study to shed light on writers’ cognitive processes while writing with next-phrase suggestion systems. To do so, we recruited 14 amateur writers to write two reviews each, one without suggestions and one with suggestions. Additionally, we also positively and negatively biased the suggestion system to get a diverse range of instances where writers’ opinions and the bias in the language model align or misalign to varying degrees. We found that writers interact with next-phrase suggestions in various complex ways: Writers abstracted and extracted multiple parts of the suggestions and incorporated them within their writing, even when they disagreed with the suggestion as a whole; along with evaluating the suggestions on various criteria. The suggestion system also had various effects on the writing process, such as altering the writer’s usual writing plans, leading to higher levels of distraction etc. Based on our qualitative analysis using the cognitive process model of writing by Hayes (2012) as a lens, we propose a theoretical model of ’writer-suggestion interaction’ for writing with GPT-2 (and causal language models in general) for a movie review writing task, followed by directions for future research and design.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 61\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
