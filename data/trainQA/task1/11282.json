Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

These yield four families of nonlinear birational transformations between 3D spaces that can be operated with enough flexibility for applications in computer-aided geometric design [43, ¬ß7]. More precisely, we describe the geometric constraints on the defining control points of the map that are necessary for birationality, and present constructions for such configurations. For adequately constrained control points, we prove that birationality is achieved if and only if a certain 2√ó2√ó22222\\times 2\\times 2 tensor has rank one. As a corollary, we prove that the locus of weights that ensure birationality is P1√óP1√óP1superscriptùëÉ1superscriptùëÉ1superscriptùëÉ1\\mathbb{P}^{1}\\times\\mathbb{P}^{1}\\times\\mathbb{P}^{1}. Additionally, we provide formulas for the inverse œï‚àí1superscriptitalic-œï1\\phi^{-1} as well as the explicit defining equations of the irreducible components of the base loci. Finally, we introduce a notion of ‚Äúdistance to birationality‚Äù for trilinear rational maps, and explain how to continuously deform birational maps.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
