Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Style-Preserving Lip Sync via Audio-Aware Style Reference\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Audio-driven lip sync has recently drawn significant attention due to its widespread application in the multimedia domain. Individuals exhibit distinct lip shapes when speaking the same utterance, attributed to the unique speaking styles of individuals, posing a notable challenge for audio-driven lip sync. Earlier methods for such task often bypassed the modeling of personalized speaking styles, resulting in sub-optimal lip sync conforming to the general styles. Recent lip sync techniques attempt to guide the lip sync for arbitrary audio by aggregating information from a style reference video, yet they can not preserve the speaking styles well due to their inaccuracy in style aggregation. This work proposes an innovative audio-aware style reference scheme that effectively leverages the relationships between input audio and reference audio from style reference video to address the style-preserving audio-driven lip sync. Specifically, we first develop an advanced Transformer-based model adept at predicting lip motion corresponding to the input audio, augmented by the style information aggregated through cross-attention layers from style reference video. Afterwards, to better render the lip motion into realistic talking face video, we devise a conditional latent diffusion model, integrating lip motion through modulated convolutional layers and fusing reference facial images via spatial cross-attention layers. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving precise lip sync, preserving speaking styles, and generating high-fidelity, realistic talking face videos.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
