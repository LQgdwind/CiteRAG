Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Distortion-Disentangled Contrastive Learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Self-supervised learning is well known for its remarkable performance in representation learning and various downstream computer vision tasks. Recently, Positive-pair-Only Contrastive Learning (POCL) has achieved reliable performance without the need to construct positive-negative training sets. It reduces memory requirements by lessening the dependency on the batch size. The POCL method typically uses a single objective function to extract the distortion invariant representation (DIR) which describes the proximity of positive-pair representations affected by different distortions. This objective function implicitly enables the model to filter out or ignore the distortion variant representation (DVR) affected by different distortions. However, some recent studies have shown that proper use of DVR in contrastive can optimize the performance of models in some downstream domain-specific tasks. In addition, these POCL methods have been observed to be sensitive to augmentation strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel POCL framework named Distortion-Disentangled Contrastive Learning (DDCL) and a Distortion-Disentangled Loss (DDL). Our approach is the first to explicitly and adaptively disentangle and exploit the DVR inside the model and feature stream to improve the representation utilization efficiency, robustness and representation ability. Experiments demonstrate our framework’s superiority to Barlow Twins and Simsiam in terms of convergence, representation quality (including transferability and generalization), and robustness on several datasets.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
