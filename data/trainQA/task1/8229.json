Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Context-Aware Selective Label Smoothing for Calibrating Sequence Recognition Model\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Despite the success of deep neural network (DNN) on sequential data (i.e., scene text and speech) recognition, it suffers from the over-confidence problem mainly due to overfitting in training with the cross-entropy loss, which may make the decision-making less reliable. Confidence calibration has been recently proposed as one effective solution to this problem. Nevertheless, the majority of existing confidence calibration methods aims at non-sequential data, which is limited if directly applied to sequential data since the intrinsic contextual dependency in sequences or the class-specific statistical prior is seldom exploited. To the end, we propose a Context-Aware Selective Label Smoothing (CASLS) method for calibrating sequential data. The proposed CASLS fully leverages the contextual dependency in sequences to construct confusion matrices of contextual prediction statistics over different classes. Class-specific error rates are then used to adjust the weights of smoothing strength in order to achieve adaptive calibration. Experimental results on sequence recognition tasks, including scene text recognition and speech recognition, demonstrate that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
