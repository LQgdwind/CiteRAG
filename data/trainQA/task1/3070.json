Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: GAN-Based Interactive Reinforcement Learning from Demonstration and Human Evaluative Feedback\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great successes in many simulated tasks. The sample inefficiency problem makes applying traditional DRL methods to real-world robots a great challenge. Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) — a general model-free imitation learning method, allows robots to directly learn policies from expert trajectories in large environments. However, GAIL shares the limitation of other imitation learning methods that they can seldom surpass the performance of demonstrations. In this paper, to address the limit of GAIL, we propose GAN-Based Interactive Reinforcement Learning (GAIRL) from demonstration and human evaluative feedback by combining the advantages of GAIL and interactive reinforcement learning. We tested our proposed method in six physics-based control tasks, ranging from simple low-dimensional control tasks — Cart Pole and Mountain Car, to difficult high-dimensional tasks — Inverted Double Pendulum, Lunar Lander, Hopper and HalfCheetah. Our results suggest that with both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations, a GAIRL agent can always learn a more stable policy with optimal or close to optimal performance, while the performance of the GAIL agent is upper bounded by the performance of demonstrations or even worse than it. In addition, our results indicate the reason that GAIRL is superior over GAIL is the complementary effect of demonstrations and human evaluative feedback.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
