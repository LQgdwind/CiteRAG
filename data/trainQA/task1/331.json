Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 68 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: Vector symbolic architectures for context-free grammars\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Background / introduction. Vector symbolic architectures (VSA) are a viable approach for the hyperdimensional representation of symbolic data, such as documents, syntactic structures, or semantic frames. Methods. We present a rigorous mathematical framework for the representation of phrase structure trees and parse trees of context-free grammars (CFG) in Fock space, i.e. infinite-dimensional Hilbert space as being used in quantum field theory. We define a novel normal form for CFG by means of term algebras. Using a recently developed software toolbox, called FockBox, we construct Fock space representations for the trees built up by a CFG left-corner (LC) parser. Results. We prove a universal representation theorem for CFG term algebras in Fock space and illustrate our findings through a low-dimensional principal component projection of the LC parser states. Conclusions. Our approach could leverage the development of VSA for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) by means of hyperdimensional deep neural computation. It could be of significance for the improvement of cognitive user interfaces and other applications of VSA in machine learning.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 68 most likely reference titles for this paper.
