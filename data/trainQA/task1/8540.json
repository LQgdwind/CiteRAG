Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Hi Sheldon! Creating Deep Personalized Characters from TV Shows\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Imagine an interesting multimodal interactive scenario that you can see, hear, and chat with an AI-generated digital character, who is capable of behaving like Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory, as a DEEP copy from appearance to personality. Towards this fantastic multimodal chatting scenario, we propose a novel task, named Deep Personalized Character Creation (DPCC): creating multimodal chat personalized characters from multimodal data such as TV shows. Specifically, given a single- or multi-modality input (text, audio, video), the goal of DPCC is to generate a multi-modality (text, audio, video) response, which should be well-matched the personality of a specific character such as Sheldon, and of high quality as well. To support this novel task, we further collect a character centric multimodal dialogue dataset, named Deep Personalized Character Dataset (DPCD), from TV shows. DPCD contains character-specific multimodal dialogue data of 10k utterances and 6 hours of audio/video per character, which is around 10 times larger compared to existing related datasets. On DPCD, we present a baseline method for the DPCC task and create 5 Deep personalized digital Characters (DeepCharacters) from Big Bang TV Shows. We conduct both subjective and objective experiments to evaluate the multimodal response from DeepCharacters in terms of characterization and quality. The results demonstrates that, on our collected DPCD dataset, the proposed baseline can create personalized digital characters for generating multimodal response. Our collected DPCD dataset, the code of data collection and our baseline will be published soon. 111DPCD github repo..\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
