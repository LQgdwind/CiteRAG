Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Temporal Ensemble Logic\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We introduce Temporal Ensemble Logic (TEL), a monadic, first-order modal logic for linear-time temporal reasoning. TEL includes primitive temporal constructs such as ‚Äúalways up to tùë°t time later‚Äù (‚ñ°tsubscript‚ñ°ùë°\\Box_{t}), ‚Äúsometimes before tùë°t time in the future‚Äù (‚óátsubscript‚óáùë°\\Diamond_{t}), and ‚Äútùë°t-time later‚Äù œÜtsubscriptùúëùë°\\varphi_{t}. TEL has been motivated from the requirement for rigor and reproducibility for cohort specification and discovery in clinical and population health research, to fill a gap in formalizing temporal reasoning in biomedicine. Existing logical frameworks such as linear temporal logic are too restrictive to express temporal and sequential properties in biomedicine, or too permissive in semantic constructs, such as in Halpern-Shoham logic, to serve this purpose. In this paper, we first introduce TEL in a general set up, with discrete and dense time as special cases. We then focus on the theoretical development of discrete TEL on the temporal domain of positive integers ‚Ñï+superscript‚Ñï\\mathbb{N}^{+}, denoted as TEL‚Ñï+subscriptTELsuperscript‚Ñï{\\rm TEL}_{\\mathbb{N}^{+}}. TEL‚Ñï+subscriptTELsuperscript‚Ñï{\\rm TEL}_{\\mathbb{N}^{+}} is strictly more expressive than the standard monadic second order logic, characterized by B√ºchi automata. We present its formal semantics, a proof system, and provide a proof for the undecidability of the satisfiability of TEL‚Ñï+subscriptTELsuperscript‚Ñï{\\rm TEL}_{\\mathbb{N}^{+}}. We also include initial results on expressiveness and decidability fragments for TEL‚Ñï+subscriptTELsuperscript‚Ñï{\\rm TEL}_{\\mathbb{N}^{+}}, followed by application outlook and discussions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
