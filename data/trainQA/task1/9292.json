Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: PANet: LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation with Sparse Instance Proposal and Aggregation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Reliable LiDAR panoptic segmentation (LPS), including both semantic and instance segmentation, is vital for many robotic applications, such as autonomous driving. This work proposes a new LPS framework named PANet to eliminate the dependency on the offset branch and improve the performance on large objects, which are always over-segmented by clustering algorithms. Firstly, we propose a non-learning Sparse Instance Proposal (SIP) module with the “sampling-shifting-grouping” scheme to directly group thing points into instances from the raw point cloud efficiently. More specifically, balanced point sampling is introduced to generate sparse seed points with more uniform point distribution over the distance range. And a shift module, termed bubble shifting, is proposed to shrink the seed points to the clustered centers. Then we utilize the connected component label algorithm to generate instance proposals. Furthermore, an instance aggregation module is devised to integrate potentially fragmented instances, improving the performance of the SIP module on large objects. Extensive experiments show that PANet achieves state-of-the-art performance among published works on the SemanticKITII validation and nuScenes validation for the panoptic segmentation task. Code is available at https://github.com/Jieqianyu/PANet.git.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
