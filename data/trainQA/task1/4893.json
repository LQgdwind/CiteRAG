Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Self-supervised Graph Learning for Occasional Group Recommendation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract As an important branch in Recommender System, occasional group recommendation has received more and more attention. In this scenario, each occasional group (cold-start group) has no or few historical interacted items. As each occasional group has extremely sparse interactions with items, traditional group recommendation methods can not learn high-quality group representations. The recent proposed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which incorporate the high-order neighbors of the target occasional group, can alleviate the above problem in some extent. However, these GNNs still can not explicitly strengthen the embedding quality of the high-order neighbors with few interactions. Motivated by the Self-supervised Learning technique, which is able to find the correlations within the data itself, we propose a self-supervised graph learning framework, which takes the user/item/group embedding reconstruction as the pretext task to enhance the embeddings of the cold-start users/items/groups. In order to explicitly enhance the high-order cold-start neighborsâ€˜ embedding quality, we further introduce an embedding enhancer, which leverages the self-attention mechanism to improve the embedding quality for them. Comprehensive experiments show the advantages of our proposed framework than the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
