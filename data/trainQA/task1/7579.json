      "content": "Paper Title: Implicit Convolutional Kernels for Steerable CNNs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Steerable convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a general framework for building neural networks equivariant to translations and transformations of an origin-preserving group Gùê∫G, such as reflections and rotations. They rely on standard convolutions with Gùê∫G-steerable kernels obtained by analytically solving the group-specific equivariance constraint imposed onto the kernel space. As the solution is tailored to a particular group Gùê∫G, implementing a kernel basis does not generalize to other symmetry transformations, complicating the development of general group equivariant models. We propose using implicit neural representation via multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to parameterize Gùê∫G-steerable kernels. The resulting framework offers a simple and flexible way to implement Steerable CNNs and generalizes to any group Gùê∫G for which a Gùê∫G-equivariant MLP can be built. We prove the effectiveness of our method on multiple tasks, including N-body simulations, point cloud classification and molecular property prediction.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 56 most likely reference titles for this paper.
