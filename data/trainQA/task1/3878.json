Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: DIVINE: Diverse Influential Training Points for Data Visualization and Model Refinement\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract As the complexity of machine learning (ML) models increases, resulting in a lack of prediction explainability, several methods have been developed to explain a model’s behavior in terms of the training data points that most influence the model. However, these methods tend to mark outliers as highly influential points, limiting the insights that practitioners can draw from points that are not representative of the training data. In this work, we take a step towards finding influential training points that also represent the training data well. We first review methods for assigning importance scores to training points. Given importance scores, we propose a method to select a set of DIVerse INfluEntial (DIVINE) training points as a useful explanation of model behavior. As practitioners might not only be interested in finding data points influential with respect to model accuracy, but also with respect to other important metrics, we show how to evaluate training data points on the basis of group fairness. Our method can identify unfairness-inducing training points, which can be removed to improve fairness outcomes. Our quantitative experiments and user studies show that visualizing DIVINE points helps practitioners understand and explain model behavior better than earlier approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
