Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: TACOS: Task Agnostic Continual Learning in Spiking Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Catastrophic interference, the loss of previously learned information when learning new information, remains a major challenge in machine learning. Since living organisms do not seem to suffer from this problem, researchers have taken inspiration from biology to improve memory retention in artificial intelligence systems. However, previous attempts to use bio-inspired mechanisms have typically resulted in systems that rely on task boundary information during training and/or explicit task identification during inference, information that is not available in real-world scenarios. Here, we show that neuro-inspired mechanisms such as synaptic consolidation and metaplasticity can mitigate catastrophic interference in a spiking neural network, using only synapse-local information, with no need for task awareness, and with a fixed memory size that does not need to be increased when training on new tasks. Our model, TACOS, combines neuromodulation with complex synaptic dynamics to enable new learning while protecting previous information. We evaluate TACOS on sequential image recognition tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing catastrophic interference. Our results show that TACOS outperforms existing regularization techniques in domain-incremental learning scenarios. We also report the results of an ablation study to elucidate the contribution of each neuro-inspired mechanism separately.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
