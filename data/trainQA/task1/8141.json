Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Fraud’s Bargain Attack: Generating Adversarial Text Samples via Word Manipulation Process\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent research has revealed that natural language processing (NLP) models are vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, the current techniques for generating such examples rely on deterministic heuristic rules, which fail to produce optimal adversarial examples. In response, this study proposes a new method called the Fraud’s Bargain Attack (FBA), which uses a randomization mechanism to expand the search space and produce high-quality adversarial examples with a higher probability of success. FBA uses the Metropolis-Hasting sampler, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler, to improve the selection of adversarial examples from all candidates generated by a customized stochastic process called the Word Manipulation Process (WMP). The WMP method modifies individual words in a contextually-aware manner through insertion, removal, or substitution. Through extensive experiments, this study demonstrates that FBA outperforms other methods in terms of attack success rate, imperceptibility and sentence quality.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper.
