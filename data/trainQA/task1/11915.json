Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: High-level hybridization of heuristics and metaheuristics to solve symmetric TSP: a comparative study\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The Travelling Salesman Problem - TSP is one of the most explored problems in the scientific literature to solve real problems regarding the economy, transportation, and logistics, to cite a few cases. Adapting TSP to solve different problems has originated several variants of the optimization problem with more complex objectives and different restrictions. Metaheuristics have been used to solve the problem in polynomial time. Several studies have tried hybridising metaheuristics with specialised heuristics to improve the quality of the solutions. However, we have found no study to evaluate whether the searching mechanism of a particular metaheuristic is more adequate for exploring hybridization. This paper focuses on the solution of the classical TSP using high-level hybridisations, experimenting with eight metaheuristics and heuristics derived from k-OPT, SISR, and segment intersection search, resulting in twenty-four combinations. Some combinations allow more than one set of searching parameters. Problems with 50 to 280 cities are solved. Parameter tuning of the metaheuristics is not carried out, exploiting the different searching patterns of the eight metaheuristics instead. The solutions’ quality is compared to those presented in the literature.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper.
