      "content": "Paper Title: Binarized ResNet: Enabling Robust Automatic Modulation Classification at the resource-constrained Edge\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used extensively for automatic modulation classification (AMC). Typically, DNNs are unsuitable for deployment at resource-constrained edge networks due to their high complexity. They are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which is a significant security concern. This work proposes a rotated binary large ResNet (RBLResNet) for AMC that can be deployed at the edge network because of low complexity. The performance gap between the RBLResNet and existing architectures with floating-point weights and activations can be closed by two proposed ensemble methods: (i) multilevel classification (MC), and (ii) bagging multiple RBLResNets. The MC method achieves an accuracy of 93.39%percent93.3993.39\\% at 101010dB over all the 242424 modulation classes of the Deepsig dataset. This performance is comparable to state-of-the-art performances, with 4.754.754.75 times lower memory and 121412141214 times lower computation. Furthermore, RBLResNet also has high adversarial robustness compared to existing DNN models. The proposed MC method with RBLResNets has an adversarial accuracy of 87.25%percent87.2587.25\\% over a wide range of SNRs, surpassing the robustness of existing methods to the best of our knowledge. Low memory, low computation, and the highest adversarial robustness make it a better choice for robust AMC in low-power edge devices.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
