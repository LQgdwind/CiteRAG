Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Succinct Trit-array Trie for Scalable Trajectory Similarity Search\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Massive datasets of spatial trajectories representing the mobility of a diversity of moving objects are ubiquitous in research and industry. Similarity search of a large collection of trajectories is indispensable for turning these datasets into knowledge. Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) is a powerful technique for fast similarity searches. Recent methods employ LSH and attempt to realize an efficient similarity search of trajectories; however, those methods are inefficient in terms of search time and memory when applied to massive datasets. To address this problem, we present the trajectory-indexing succinct trit-array trie (tSTAT), which is a scalable method leveraging LSH for trajectory similarity searches. tSTAT quickly performs the search on a tree data structure called trie. We also present two novel techniques that enable to dramatically enhance the memory efficiency of tSTAT. One is a node reduction technique that substantially omits redundant trie nodes while maintaining the time performance. The other is a space-efficient representation that leverages the idea behind succinct data structures (i.e., a compressed data structure supporting fast data operations). We experimentally test tSTAT on its ability to retrieve similar trajectories for a query from large collections of trajectories and show that tSTAT performs superiorly in comparison to state-of-the-art similarity search methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
