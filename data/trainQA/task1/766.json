Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: DAMIA: Leveraging Domain Adaptation as a Defense against Membership Inference Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep Learning (DL) techniques allow one to train a model from a dataset, and the model can be adopted to solve tasks. DL has attracted much interest given its fancy performance and potential market value, while security issues are amongst the most colossal concerns. Being a core engine of DL, models may be prone to the membership inference attack, where an attacker determines whether a given sample is from the dataset the model trained on. Efforts have been made to hinder the attack but unfortunately, they may be subject to a major overhead or impaired usability. In this paper, we propose and implement DAMIA, leveraging Domain Adaptation (DA) as a defense to counter membership inference attacks. Our observation is that during the training process, DA obfuscates the dataset to be protected using another related dataset, and derives a model that underlyingly extracts the features from both the original dataset and the introduced dataset. Seeing that the model is obfuscated, membership inference fails, while the extracted common features provide supports for usability. Extensive experiments have been conducted, which validates our intuition. The model counters the membership inference attacks and has a negligible footprint to the usability. Our experiment also excludes a few factors that may hinder the performance of DAMIA, providing a potential guideline that instructs the vendors and researchers to benefit from our solution in a timely manner.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
