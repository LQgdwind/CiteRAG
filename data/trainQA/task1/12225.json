Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 54 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Sign-IDD: Iconicity Disentangled Diffusion for Sign Language Production\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to generate semantically consistent sign videos from textual statements, where the conversion from textual glosses to sign poses (G2P) is a crucial step. Existing G2P methods typically treat sign poses as discrete three-dimensional coordinates and directly fit them, which overlooks the relative positional relationships among joints. To this end, we provide a new perspective, constraining joint associations and gesture details by modeling the limb bones to improve the accuracy and naturalness of the generated poses. In this work, we propose a pioneering iconicity disentangled diffusion framework, termed Sign-IDD, specifically designed for SLP. Sign-IDD incorporates a novel Iconicity Disentanglement (ID) module to bridge the gap between relative positions among joints. The ID module disentangles the conventional 3D joint representation into a 4D bone representation, comprising the 3D spatial direction vector and 1D spatial distance vector between adjacent joints. Additionally, an Attribute Controllable Diffusion (ACD) module is introduced to further constrain joint associations, in which the attribute separation layer aims to separate the bone direction and length attributes, and the attribute control layer is designed to guide the pose generation by leveraging the above attributes. The ACD module utilizes the gloss embeddings as semantic conditions and finally generates sign poses from noise embeddings. Extensive experiments on PHOENIX14T and USTC-CSL datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at: https://github.com/NaVi-start/Sign-IDD.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 54 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 54\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
