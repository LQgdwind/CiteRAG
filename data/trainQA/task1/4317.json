Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 61 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Backdoor Attack on Hash-based Image Retrieval via Clean-label Data Poisoning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract A backdoored deep hashing model is expected to behave normally on original query images and return the images with the target label when a specific trigger pattern presents. To this end, we propose the confusing perturbations-induced backdoor attack (CIBA). It injects a small number of poisoned images with the correct label into the training data, which makes the attack hard to be detected. To craft the poisoned images, we first propose the confusing perturbations to disturb the hashing code learning. As such, the hashing model can learn more about the trigger. The confusing perturbations are imperceptible and generated by optimizing the intra-class dispersion and inter-class shift in the Hamming space. We then employ the targeted adversarial patch as the backdoor trigger to improve the attack performance. We have conducted extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed CIBA. Our code is available at https://github.com/KuofengGao/CIBA.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 61 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 61\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
