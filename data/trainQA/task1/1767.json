Namely, we show that the structure of every algorithm that makes qùëûq adaptive queries and satisfies a natural robustness condition admits a sample-based algorithm with n1‚àí1/O‚Äã(q2‚Äãlog2‚Å°q)superscriptùëõ11ùëÇsuperscriptùëû2superscript2ùëûn^{1-1/O(q^{2}\\log^{2}q)} sample complexity, following the definition of Goldreich and Ron (TOCT 2016). We prove that this transformation is nearly optimal. Our theorem also admits a scheme for constructing privacy-preserving local algorithms. Using the unified view that our structural theorem provides, we obtain results regarding various types of local algorithms, including the following. ‚Ä¢ We strengthen the state-of-the-art lower bound for relaxed locally decodable codes, obtaining an exponential improvement on the dependency in query complexity; this resolves an open problem raised by Gur and Lachish (SICOMP 2021). ‚Ä¢ We show that any (constant-query) testable property admits a sample-based tester with sublinear sample complexity; this resolves a problem left open in a work of Fischer, Lachish, and Vasudev (FOCS 2015), bypassing an exponential blowup caused by previous techniques in the case of adaptive testers. ‚Ä¢ We prove that the known separation between proofs of proximity and testers is essentially maximal; this resolves a problem left open by Gur and Rothblum (ECCC 2013, Computational Complexity 2018) regarding sublinear-time delegation of computation. Our techniques strongly rely on relaxed sunflower lemmas and the Hajnal‚ÄìSzemer√©di theorem. Keywords: local algorithms, sample-based algorithms, coding theory, property testing, adaptivity, sunflower lemmas.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
