Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Robust design optimisation of continuous flow polymerase chain reaction thermal flow systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper presents an efficient methodology for the robust optimisation of Continuous Flow Polymerase Chain Reaction (CFPCR) devices. It enables the effects of uncertainties in device geometry, due to manufacturing tolerances, on the competing objectives of minimising the temperature deviations within the CFPCR thermal zones, together with minimising the pressure drop across the device, to be explored. We first validate that our training data from conjugate heat transfer simulations of the CFPCR thermal flow problems is noise free and then combine a deterministic surrogate model, based on the mean of a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) simulator, with Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) to propagate the manufacturing uncertainties in the geometry design variables into the optimisation outputs. The resultant probabilistic model is used to solve a series of robust optimisation problems. The influence of the robust problem formulation and constraints on the design conservatism of the robust optima in comparison with the corresponding deterministic cases is explored briefly.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
