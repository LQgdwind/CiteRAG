Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Generalized Deployable Elastic Geodesic Grids\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Given a designer created free-form surface in 3d space, our method computes a grid composed of elastic elements which are completely planar and straight. Only by fixing the ends of the planar elements to appropriate locations, the 2d grid bends and approximates the given 3d surface. Our method is based purely on the notions from differential geometry of curves and surfaces and avoids any physical simulations. In particular, we introduce a well-defined elastic grid energy functional that allows identifying networks of curves that minimize the bending energy and at the same time nestle to the provided input surface well. Further, we generalize the concept of such grids to cases where the surface boundary does not need to be convex, which allows for the creation of sophisticated and visually pleasing shapes. The algorithm finally ensures that the 2d grid is perfectly planar, making the resulting gridshells inexpensive, easy to fabricate, transport, assemble, and finally also to deploy. Additionally, since the whole structure is pre-strained, it also comes with load-bearing capabilities. We evaluate our method using physical simulation and we also provide a full fabrication pipeline for desktop-size models and present multiple examples of surfaces with elliptic and hyperbolic curvature regions. Our method is meant as a tool for quick prototyping for designers, architects, and engineers since it is very fast and results can be obtained in a matter of seconds.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
