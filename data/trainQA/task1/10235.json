Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 59 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Measure Theoretic Reeb Graphs and Reeb Spaces\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. A Reeb graph is a graphical representation of a scalar function f:X‚Üí‚Ñù:ùëì‚Üíùëã‚Ñùf:{{X}}\\to{\\mathbb{R}} on a topological space Xùëã{{X}} that encodes the topology of the level sets. A Reeb space is a generalization of the Reeb graph to a multivariate function f:X‚Üí‚Ñùd:ùëì‚Üíùëãsuperscript‚Ñùùëëf:{{X}}\\to{\\mathbb{R}}^{d}. In this paper, we propose novel constructions of Reeb graphs and Reeb spaces that incorporate the use of a measure. Specifically, we introduce measure theoretic Reeb graphs and Reeb spaces when the domain or the range is modeled as a metric measure space (i.e., a metric space equipped with a measure). Our main goal is to enhance the robustness of the Reeb graph and Reeb space in representing the topological features of a scalar field while accounting for the distribution of the measure. We first prove the stability of our measure theoretic constructions with respect to the interleaving distance. We then prove their stability with respect to the measure, defined using the distance to a measure or the kernel distance to a measure, respectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
