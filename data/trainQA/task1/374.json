Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Lower Bounds on the Running Time of Two-Way Quantum Finite Automata and Sublogarithmic-Space Quantum Turing Machines\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The two-way finite automaton with quantum and classical states (2QCFA), defined by Ambainis and Watrous, is a model of quantum computation whose quantum part is extremely limited; however, as they showed, 2QCFA are surprisingly powerful: a 2QCFA with only a single-qubit can recognize the language Lp​a​l={w∈{a,b}∗:w​ is a palindrome}subscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙conditional-set𝑤superscript𝑎𝑏𝑤 is a palindromeL_{pal}=\\{w\\in\\{a,b\\}^{*}:w\\text{ is a palindrome}\\} with bounded error in expected time 2O​(n)superscript2𝑂𝑛2^{O(n)}. We prove that their result cannot be improved upon: a 2QCFA (of any size) cannot recognize Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} with bounded error in expected time 2o​(n)superscript2𝑜𝑛2^{o(n)}. This is the first example of a language that can be recognized with bounded error by a 2QCFA in exponential time but not in subexponential time. Moreover, we prove that a quantum Turing machine (QTM) running in space o​(log⁡n)𝑜𝑛o(\\log n) and expected time 2n1−Ω​(1)superscript2superscript𝑛1Ω12^{n^{1-\\Omega(1)}} cannot recognize Lp​a​lsubscript𝐿𝑝𝑎𝑙L_{pal} with bounded error; again, this is the first lower bound of its kind. Far more generally, we establish a lower bound on the running time of any 2QCFA or o​(log⁡n)𝑜𝑛o(\\log n)-space QTM that recognizes any language L𝐿L in terms of a natural “hardness measure” of L𝐿L. This allows us to exhibit a large family of languages for which we have asymptotically matching lower and upper bounds on the running time of any such 2QCFA or QTM recognizer.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
