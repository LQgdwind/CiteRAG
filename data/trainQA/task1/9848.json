Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Physics-inspired Neural Networks for Parameter Learning of Adaptive Cruise Control Systems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper proposes and develops a physics-inspired neural network (PiNN) for learning the parameters of commercially implemented adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems in automotive industry. To emulate the core functionality of stock ACC systems, which have proprietary control logic and undisclosed parameters, the constant time-headway policy (CTHP) is adopted. Leveraging the multi-layer artificial neural networks as universal approximators, the developed PiNN serves as a surrogate model for the longitudinal dynamics of ACC-engaged vehicles, efficiently learning the unknown parameters of the CTHP. The ability of the PiNN to infer the unknown ACC parameters is meticulous evaluated using both synthetic and high-fidelity empirical data of space-gap and relative velocity involving ACC-engaged vehicles in platoon formation. The results have demonstrated the superior predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in learning the unknown design parameters of stock ACC systems from different car manufacturers. The set of ACC model parameters obtained from the PiNN revealed that the stock ACC systems of the considered vehicles in three experimental campaigns are neither ‚Ñí2subscript‚Ñí2{\\cal L}_{2} nor ‚Ñí‚àûsubscript‚Ñí{\\cal L}_{\\infty} string stable.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
