      "content": "Paper Title: Continuous Submodular Maximization: Beyond DR-Submodularity\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we propose the first continuous optimization algorithms that achieve a constant factor approximation guarantee for the problem of monotone continuous submodular maximization subject to a linear constraint. We first prove that a simple variant of the vanilla coordinate ascent, called Coordinate-Ascent+, achieves a (e−12​e−1−ε)𝑒12𝑒1𝜀(\\frac{e-1}{2e-1}-\\varepsilon)-approximation guarantee while performing O​(n/ε)𝑂𝑛𝜀O(n/\\varepsilon) iterations, where the computational complexity of each iteration is roughly O​(n/ε+n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝜀𝑛𝑛O(n/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}+n\\log n) (here, n𝑛n denotes the dimension of the optimization problem). We then propose Coordinate-Ascent++, that achieves the tight (1−1/e−ε)11𝑒𝜀(1-1/e-\\varepsilon)-approximation guarantee while performing the same number of iterations, but at a higher computational complexity of roughly O​(n3/ε2.5+n3​log⁡n/ε2)𝑂superscript𝑛3superscript𝜀2.5superscript𝑛3𝑛superscript𝜀2O(n^{3}/\\varepsilon^{2.5}+n^{3}\\log n/\\varepsilon^{2}) per iteration. However, the computation of each round of Coordinate-Ascent++ can be easily parallelized so that the computational cost per machine scales as O​(n/ε+n​log⁡n)𝑂𝑛𝜀𝑛𝑛O(n/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}+n\\log n).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
