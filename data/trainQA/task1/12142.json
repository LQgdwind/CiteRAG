Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: Memristor-Based Selective Convolutional Circuit for High-Density Salt-and-Pepper Noise Removal\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this article, we propose a memristor-based selective convolutional (MSC) circuit for salt-and-pepper (SAP) noise removal. We implement its algorithm using memristors in analog circuits. In experiments, we build the MSC model and benchmark it against a ternary selective convolutional (TSC) model. Results show that the MSC model effectively restores images corrupted by SAP noise, achieving similar performance to the TSC model in both quantitative measures and visual quality at noise densities of up to 50%. Note that at high noise densities, the performance of the MSC model even surpasses the theoretical benchmark of its corresponding TSC model. In addition, we propose an enhanced MSC (MSCE) model based on MSC, which reduces power consumption by 57.6% compared with the MSC model while improving performance.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
