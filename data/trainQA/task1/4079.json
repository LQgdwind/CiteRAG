Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Jujutsu: A Two-stage Defense against Adversarial Patch Attacks on Deep Neural Networks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Adversarial patch attacks create adversarial examples by injecting arbitrary distortions within a bounded region of the input to fool deep neural networks (DNNs). These attacks are robust (i.e., physically-realizable) and universally malicious, and hence represent a severe security threat to real-world DNN-based systems. We propose Jujutsu, a two-stage technique to detect and mitigate robust and universal adversarial patch attacks. We first observe that adversarial patches are crafted as localized features that yield large influence on the prediction output, and continue to dominate the prediction on any input. Jujutsu leverages this observation for accurate attack detection with low false positives. Patch attacks corrupt only a localized region of the input, while the majority of the input remains unperturbed. Therefore, Jujutsu leverages generative adversarial networks (GAN) to perform localized attack recovery by synthesizing the semantic contents of the input that are corrupted by the attacks, and reconstructs a “clean” input for correct prediction. We evaluate Jujutsu on four diverse datasets spanning 8 different DNN models, and find that it achieves superior performance and significantly outperforms four existing defenses. We further evaluate Jujutsu against physical-world attacks, as well as adaptive attacks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
