Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: A Spreader Ranking Algorithm for Extremely Low-Budget Influence Maximization in Social Networks using Community Bridge Nodes\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In recent years, social networking platforms have gained significant popularity among the masses like connecting with people and propagating one’s thoughts and opinions. This has opened the door to user-specific advertisements and recommendations on these platforms, bringing along a significant focus on Influence Maximisation (IM) on social networks due to its wide applicability in target advertising, viral marketing, and personalized recommendations. The aim of IM is to identify certain nodes in the network which can help maximize the spread of certain information through a diffusion cascade. While several works have been proposed for IM, most were inefficient in exploiting community structures to their full extent. In this work, we propose a community structures-based approach, which employs a K-Shell algorithm in order to generate a score for the connections between seed nodes and communities for low-budget scenarios. Further, our approach employs entropy within communities to ensure the proper spread of information within the communities. We choose the Independent Cascade (IC) model to simulate information spread and evaluate it on four evaluation metrics. We validate our proposed approach on eight publicly available networks and find that it significantly outperforms the baseline approaches on these metrics, while still being relatively efficient. ††*Equal Contribution\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 55\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
