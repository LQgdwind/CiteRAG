      "content": "Paper Title: A Stable Mixed FE Method for Nearly Incompressible Linear Elastostatics\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract [Summary] We present a new, stable, mixed finite element (FE) method for linear elastostatics of nearly incompressible solids. The method is the automatic variationally stable FE (AVS-FE) method of Calo, Romkes and Valseth, in which we consider a Petrov-Galerkin weak formulation where the stress and displacement variables are in the space H‚Äã(ùêùùê¢ùêØ)ùêªùêùùê¢ùêØH(\\bf{div}) and H1superscriptùêª1H^{1}, respectively. This allows us to employ a fully conforming FE discretization for any elastic solid using classical FE subspaces of H‚Äã(ùêùùê¢ùêØ)ùêªùêùùê¢ùêØH(\\bf{div}) and H1superscriptùêª1H^{1}. Hence, the resulting FE approximation yields both continuous stresses and displacements. To ensure stability of the method, we employ the philosophy of the discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) method of Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan and use optimal test spaces. Thus, the resulting FE discretization is stable even as the Poisson‚Äôs ratio ŒΩ‚Üí0.5‚Üíùúà0.5\\nu\\rightarrow 0.5, and the system of linear algebraic equations is symmetric and positive definite. Our method also comes with a built-in a posteriori error estimator as well as indicators which are used to drive mesh adaptive refinements. We present several numerical verifications of our method including comparisons to existing FE technologies.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
