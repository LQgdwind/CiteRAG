      "content": "Paper Title: HSONet:A Siamese foreground association-driven hard case sample optimization network for high-resolution remote sensing image change detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Deep learning technologies have driven significant advances in change detection (CD) techniques. RS-CD relies on the model’s ability to learn features of marked change objects, known as foreground targets. In addition to foreground targets, the most valuable samples in the image space for model optimization are the unlabelled and semantically ambiguous samples in the background, which include hard samples, pseudochanges, and noninteresting changes; these samples are collectively referred to as ”hard case samples” in this paper. In the later training stages, further improvement of the model’s ability to determine changes relies on how well the model learns hard cases; however, there are two additional challenges to learning hard case samples: (1) change labels are limited and tend to pointer only to foreground targets, yet hard case samples are prevalent in the background, which leads to optimizing the loss function focusing on the foreground targets and ignoring the background hard cases, which we call ’imbalance’. (2) Complex situations, such as light shadows, target occlusion, and seasonal changes, induce hard case samples, and in the absence of both supervisory and scene information, it is difficult for the model to learn hard case samples directly to accurately obtain the feature representations of the change information, which we call ’missingness’. We propose a Siamese foreground association-driven hard case sample optimization network (HSONet). To deal with this imbalance, we propose an equilibrium optimization loss function to regulate the optimization focus of the foreground and background, determine the hard case samples through the distribution of the loss values, and introduce dynamic weights in the loss term to gradually shift the optimization focus of the loss from the foreground to the background hard cases as the training progresses. To address this missingness, we understand hard case samples with the help of the scene context, propose the scene-foreground association module, use potential remote sensing spatial scene information to model the association between the target of interest in the foreground and the related context to obtain scene embedding, and apply this information to the feature reinforcement of hard cases. Experiments on four public datasets show that HSONet outperforms current state-of-the-art CD methods, particularly in detecting hard case samples.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
