Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 60 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer.

      "content": "Paper Title: WISDOM: An AI-powered framework for emerging research detection using weak signal analysis and advanced topic modeling\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The landscape of science and technology is characterized by its dynamic and evolving nature, constantly reshaped by new discoveries, innovations, and paradigm shifts. Moreover, science is undergoing a remarkable shift towards increasing interdisciplinary collaboration, where the convergence of diverse fields fosters innovative solutions to complex problems. Detecting emerging scientific topics is paramount as it enables industries, policymakers, and innovators to adapt their strategies, investments, and regulations proactively. As the common approach for detecting emerging technologies, despite being useful, bibliometric analyses may suffer from oversimplification and/or misinterpretation of complex interdisciplinary trends. In addition, relying solely on domain experts to pinpoint emerging technologies from science and technology trends might restrict the ability to systematically analyze extensive information and introduce subjective judgments into the interpretations. To overcome these drawbacks, in this work, we present an automated artificial intelligence-enabled framework, called WISDOM, for detecting emerging research themes using advanced topic modeling and weak signal analysis. The proposed approach can assist strategic planners and domain experts in more effectively recognizing and tracking trends related to emerging topics by swiftly processing and analyzing vast volumes of data, uncovering hidden cross-disciplinary patterns, and offering unbiased insights, thereby enhancing the efficiency and objectivity of the detection process. As the case technology, we assess WISDOM’s performance in identifying emerging research as well as their trends, in the field of underwater sensing technologies using scientific papers published between 2004 and 2021.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 60 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 60\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
