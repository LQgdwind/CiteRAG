Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Contrastive Learning for Compact Single Image Dehazing\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Single image dehazing is a challenging ill-posed problem due to the severe information degeneration. However, existing deep learning based dehazing methods only adopt clear images as positive samples to guide the training of dehazing network while negative information is unexploited. Moreover, most of them focus on strengthening the dehazing network with an increase of depth and width, leading to a significant requirement of computation and memory. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive regularization (CR) built upon contrastive learning to exploit both the information of hazy images and clear images as negative and positive samples, respectively. CR ensures that the restored image is pulled to closer to the clear image and pushed to far away from the hazy image in the representation space. Furthermore, considering trade-off between performance and memory storage, we develop a compact dehazing network based on autoencoder-like (AE) framework. It involves an adaptive mixup operation and a dynamic feature enhancement module, which can benefit from preserving information flow adaptively and expanding the receptive field to improve the networkâ€™s transformation capability, respectively. We term our dehazing network with autoencoder and contrastive regularization as AECR-Net. The extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our AECR-Net surpass the state-of-the-art approaches. The code is released in https://github.com/GlassyWu/AECR-Net.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
