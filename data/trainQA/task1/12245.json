      "content": "Paper Title: Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Placement Optimization in Vietnam Using Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming Model\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Vietnam is viewed as one of the promising markets for electric vehicles (EVs), especially automobiles when it is predicted to reach 1 million in 2028 and 3.5 million in 2040. However, the lack of charging station infrastructure has hindered the growth rate of EVs in this country. This study aims to propose an optimization model using Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) to implement an optimal location strategy for EVs charging stations in Ho Chi Minh (HCM) City. The problem is solved by a solver named Gurobi and using the Brand-and-Cut method. There are 2 perspectives including Charging Station Operators and EV users. In addition, 7 kinds of costs considered include installation cost, land rental cost, maintenance cost, operational cost, charging cost, waiting cost, and traveling cost. From 1509 Point of Interest and 199 residential areas, 134 POIs were chosen with 923 charging stations including 592 Level-2 chargers and 331 Level-3 chargers to fully satisfy the customer demand. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed model is proved by a minor MIP Gap and running in a short time with full feasibility.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
