Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Causal Video Summarizer for Video Exploration\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recently, video summarization has been proposed as a method to help video exploration. However, traditional video summarization models only generate a fixed video summary which is usually independent of user-specific needs and hence limits the effectiveness of video exploration. Multi-modal video summarization is one of the approaches utilized to address this issue. Multi-modal video summarization has a video input and a text-based query input. Hence, effective modeling of the interaction between a video input and text-based query is essential to multi-modal video summarization. In this work, a new causality-based method named Causal Video Summarizer (CVS) is proposed to effectively capture the interactive information between the video and query to tackle the task of multi-modal video summarization. The proposed method consists of a probabilistic encoder and a probabilistic decoder. Based on the evaluation of the existing multi-modal video summarization dataset, experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective with the increase of +5.45.4+5.4% in accuracy and +4.924.92+4.92% increase of F‚Äã1ùêπ1F1-score, compared with the state-of-the-art method.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
