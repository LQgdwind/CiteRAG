Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 46 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Generating Hypothetical Events for Abductive Inference\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Abductive reasoning starts from some observations and aims at finding the most plausible explanation for these observations. To perform abduction, humans often make use of temporal and causal inferences, and knowledge about how some hypothetical situation can result in different outcomes. This work offers the first study of how such knowledge impacts the Abductive Œ±ùõº\\alphaNLI task ‚Äì which consists in choosing the more likely explanation for given observations. We train a specialized language model L‚ÄãM‚ÑêùêøsubscriptùëÄ‚ÑêLM_{\\mathcal{I}} that is tasked to generate what could happen next from a hypothetical scenario that evolves from a given event. We then propose a multi-task model ‚Ñ≥‚ÄãùíØ‚Äã‚Ñí‚Ñ≥ùíØ‚Ñí\\mathcal{MTL} to solve the Œ±ùõº\\alphaNLI task, which predicts a plausible explanation by a) considering different possible events emerging from candidate hypotheses ‚Äì events generated by L‚ÄãM‚ÑêùêøsubscriptùëÄ‚ÑêLM_{\\mathcal{I}} ‚Äì and b) selecting the one that is most similar to the observed outcome. We show that our ‚Ñ≥‚ÄãùíØ‚Äã‚Ñí‚Ñ≥ùíØ‚Ñí\\mathcal{MTL} model improves over prior vanilla pre-trained LMs fine-tuned on Œ±ùõº\\alphaNLI. Our manual evaluation and analysis suggest that learning about possible next events from different hypothetical scenarios supports abductive inference.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
