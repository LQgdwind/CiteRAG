Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: HiVision: Rapid Visualization of Large-Scale Spatial Vector Data\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Rapid visualization of large-scale spatial vector data is a long-standing challenge in Geographic Information Science. In existing methods, the computation overheads grow rapidly with data volumes, leading to the incapability of providing real-time visualization for large-scale spatial vector data, even with parallel acceleration technologies. To fill the gap, we present HiVision, a display-driven visualization model for large-scale spatial vector data. Different from traditional data-driven methods, the computing units in HiVision are pixels rather than spatial objects to achieve real-time performance, and efficient spatial-index-based strategies are introduced to estimate the topological relationships between pixels and spatial objects. HiVision can maintain exceedingly good performance regardless of the data volume due to the stable pixel number for display. In addition, an optimized parallel computing architecture is proposed in HiVision to ensure the ability of real-time visualization. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional methods in rendering speed and visual effects while dealing with large-scale spatial vector data, and can provide interactive visualization of datasets with billion-scale points/segments/edges in real-time with flexible rendering styles. The HiVision code is open-sourced at https://github.com/MemoryMmy/HiVision with an online demonstration.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 47\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
