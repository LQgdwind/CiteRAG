Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 4 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Robust field-level inference of cosmological parameters with dark matter halos\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We train graph neural networks on halo catalogues from Gadget N-body simulations to perform field-level likelihood-free inference of cosmological parameters. The catalogues contain ‚â≤less-than-or-similar-to\\lesssim5,000 halos with masses ‚â≥1010‚Äãh‚àí1‚ÄãM‚äôgreater-than-or-equivalent-toabsentsuperscript1010superscript‚Ñé1subscriptùëÄdirect-product\\gtrsim 10^{10}~{}h^{-1}M_{\\odot} in a periodic volume of (25‚Äãh‚àí1‚ÄãMpc)3superscript25superscript‚Ñé1Mpc3(25~{}h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc})^{3}; every halo in the catalogue is characterized by several properties such as position, mass, velocity, concentration, and maximum circular velocity. Our models, built to be permutationally, translationally, and rotationally invariant, do not impose a minimum scale on which to extract information and are able to infer the values of Œ©msubscriptŒ©m\\Omega_{\\rm m} and œÉ8subscriptùúé8\\sigma_{8} with a mean relative error of ‚àº6%similar-toabsentpercent6\\sim 6\\%, when using positions plus velocities and positions plus masses, respectively. More importantly, we find that our models are very robust: they can infer the value of Œ©msubscriptŒ©m\\Omega_{\\rm m} and œÉ8subscriptùúé8\\sigma_{8} when tested using halo catalogues from thousands of N-body simulations run with five different N-body codes: Abacus, CUBEP3M, Enzo, PKDGrav3, and Ramses. Surprisingly, the model trained to infer Œ©msubscriptŒ©m\\Omega_{\\rm m} also works when tested on thousands of state-of-the-art CAMELS hydrodynamic simulations run with four different codes and subgrid physics implementations. Using halo properties such as concentration and maximum circular velocity allow our models to extract more information, at the expense of breaking the robustness of the models. This may happen because the different N-body codes are not converged on the relevant scales corresponding to these parameters.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 4 most likely reference titles for this paper.
