Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Diffusion Models for Computational Design at the Example of Floor Plans\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract AI Image generators based on diffusion models are widely discussed recently for their capability to create images from simple text prompts. But, for practical use in civil engineering they need to be able to create specific construction plans for given constraints. Within this paper we explore the capabilities of those diffusion-based AI generators for computational design at the example of floor plans and identify their current limitation. We explain how the diffusion-models work and propose new diffusion models with improved semantic encoding. In several experiments we show that we can improve validity of generated floor plans from 6 % to 90 % and query performance for different examples. We identify short comings and derive future research challenges of those models and discuss the need to combine diffusion models with building information modelling. With this we provide key insights into the current state and future directions for diffusion models in civil engineering.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
