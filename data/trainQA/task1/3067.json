Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Comparison and Analysis of Deep Audio Embeddings for Music Emotion Recognition\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Emotion is a complicated notion present in music that is hard to capture even with fine-tuned feature engineering. In this paper, we investigate the utility of state-of-the-art pre-trained deep audio embedding methods to be used in the Music Emotion Recognition (MER) task. Deep audio embedding methods allow us to efficiently capture the high dimensional features into a compact representation. We implement several multi-class classifiers with deep audio embeddings to predict emotion semantics in music. We investigate the effectiveness of L3superscriptùêø3L^{3}-Net and VGGish deep audio embedding methods for music emotion inference over four music datasets. The experiments with several classifiers on the task show that the deep audio embedding solutions can improve the performances of the previous baseline MER models. We conclude that deep audio embeddings represent musical emotion semantics for the MER task without expert human engineering.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
