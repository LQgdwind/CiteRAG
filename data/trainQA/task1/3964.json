Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptation of Tacotron2-based Text-To-Speech for Articulatory-to-Acoustic Mapping using Ultrasound Tongue Imaging\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract For articulatory-to-acoustic mapping, typically only limited parallel training data is available, making it impossible to apply fully end-to-end solutions like Tacotron2. In this paper, we experimented with transfer learning and adaptation of a Tacotron2 text-to-speech model to improve the final synthesis quality of ultrasound-based articulatory-to-acoustic mapping with a limited database. We use a multi-speaker pre-trained Tacotron2 TTS model and a pre-trained WaveGlow neural vocoder. The articulatory-to-acoustic conversion contains three steps: 1) from a sequence of ultrasound tongue image recordings, a 3D convolutional neural network predicts the inputs of the pre-trained Tacotron2 model, 2) the Tacotron2 model converts this intermediate representation to an 80-dimensional mel-spectrogram, and 3) the WaveGlow model is applied for final inference. This generated speech contains the timing of the original articulatory data from the ultrasound recording, but the F0 contour and the spectral information is predicted by the Tacotron2 model. The F0 values are independent of the original ultrasound images, but represent the target speaker, as they are inferred from the pre-trained Tacotron2 model. In our experiments, we demonstrated that the synthesized speech quality is more natural with the proposed solutions than with our earlier model.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
