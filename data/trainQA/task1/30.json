Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: SERAD: Soft Error Resilient Asynchronous Design using a Bundled Data Protocol\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The risk of soft errors due to radiation continues to be a significant challenge for engineers trying to build systems that can handle harsh environments. Building systems that are Radiation Hardened by Design (RHBD) is the preferred approach, but existing techniques are expensive in terms of performance, power, and/or area. This paper introduces a novel soft-error resilient asynchronous bundled-data design template, SERAD, which uses a combination of temporal and spatial redundancy to mitigate Single Event Transients (SETs) and upsets (SEUs). SERAD uses Error Detecting Logic (EDL) to detect SETs at the inputs of sequential elements and correct them via re-sampling. Because SERAD only pays the delay penalty in the presence of an SET, which rarely occurs, its average performance is comparable to the baseline synchronous design. We tested the SERAD design using a combination of Spice and Verilog simulations and evaluated its impact on area, frequency, and power on an open-core MIPS-like processor using a NCSU 45nm cell library. Our post-synthesis results show that the SERAD design consumes less than half of the area of the Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), exhibits significantly less performance degradation than Glitch Filtering (GF), and consumes no more total power than the baseline unhardened design.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
