Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: ùêø‚ÇÇBN: Enhancing Batch Normalization by Equalizing the ùêø‚ÇÇ Norms of Features\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this paper, we analyze batch normalization from the perspective of discriminability and find the disadvantages ignored by previous studies: the difference in l2subscriptùëô2l_{2} norms of sample features can hinder batch normalization from obtaining more distinguished inter-class features and more compact intra-class features. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method to equalize the l2subscriptùëô2l_{2} norms of sample features. Concretely, we l2subscriptùëô2l_{2}-normalize each sample feature before feeding them into batch normalization, and therefore the features are of the same magnitude. Since the proposed method combines the l2subscriptùëô2l_{2} normalization and batch normalization, we name our method L2subscriptùêø2L_{2}BN. The L2subscriptùêø2L_{2}BN can strengthen the compactness of intra-class features and enlarge the discrepancy of inter-class features. The L2subscriptùêø2L_{2}BN is easy to implement and can exert its effect without any additional parameters or hyper-parameters. We evaluate the effectiveness of L2subscriptùêø2L_{2}BN through extensive experiments with various models on image classification and acoustic scene classification tasks. The results demonstrate that the L2subscriptùêø2L_{2}BN can boost the generalization ability of various neural network models and achieve considerable performance improvements.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
