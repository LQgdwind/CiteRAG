Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Computing Conceptual Distances between Breast Cancer Screening Guidelines: An Implementation of a Near-Peer Epistemic Model of Medical Disagreement.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Using natural language processing tools, we investigate the differences of recommendations in medical guidelines for the same decision problem – breast cancer screening. We show that these differences arise from knowledge brought to the problem by different medical societies, as reflected in the conceptual vocabularies used by the different groups of authors. The computational models we build and analyze agree with the near-peer epistemic model of expert disagreement proposed by Garbayo. Even though the article is a case study focused on one set of guidelines, the proposed methodology is broadly applicable. In addition to proposing a novel graph-based similarity model for comparing collections of documents, we perform an extensive analysis of the model performance. In a series of a few dozen experiments, in three broad categories, we show, at a very high statistical significance level of 3-4 standard deviations for our best models, that the high similarity between expert annotated model and our concept based, automatically created, computational models is not accidental. Our best model achieves roughly 70% similarity. We also describe possible extensions of this work.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
