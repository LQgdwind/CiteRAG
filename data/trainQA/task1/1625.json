Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Particle Mesh Ewald for Molecular Dynamics in OpenCL on an FPGA Cluster\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations play a central role in physics-driven drug discovery. MD applications often use the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm to accelerate electrostatic force computations, but efficient parallelization has proven difficult due to the high communication requirements of distributed 3D FFTs. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a scalable PME algorithm that runs on a cluster of Intel Stratix 10 FPGAs and can handle FFT sizes appropriate to address real-world drug discovery projects (grids up to ùüèùüêùüñùüësuperscript1283128^{3}). To our knowledge, this is the first work to fully integrate all aspects of the PME algorithm (charge spreading, 3D FFT/IFFT, and force interpolation) within a distributed FPGA framework. The design is fully implemented with OpenCL for flexibility and ease of development and uses 100 Gbps links for direct FPGA-to-FPGA communications without the need for host interaction. We present experimental data up to 4 FPGAs (e.g., 206 microseconds per timestep for a 65536 atom simulation and ùüîùüíùüësuperscript64364^{3} 3D FFT), outperforming GPUs for smaller FFT sizes. Additionally, we discuss design scalability on clusters with differing topologies up to 64 FPGAs (with expected performance far greater than all known GPU implementations) and integration with other hardware components to form a complete molecular dynamics application. We predict best-case performance of 6.6 microseconds per timestep on 64 FPGAs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
