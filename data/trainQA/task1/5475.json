Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 62 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Engineering the Neural Automatic Passenger Counter\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Automatic passenger counting (APC) in public transportation has been approached with various machine learning and artificial intelligence methods since its introduction in the 1970s. While equivalence testing is becoming more popular than difference detection (Student’s t-test), the former is much more difficult to pass to ensure low user risk. On the other hand, recent developments in artificial intelligence have led to algorithms that promise much higher counting quality (lower bias). However, gradient-based methods (including Deep Learning) have one limitation: they typically run into local optima. In this work, we explore and exploit various aspects of machine learning to increase reliability, performance, and counting quality. We perform a grid search with several fundamental parameters: the selection and size of the training set, which is similar to cross-validation, and the initial network weights and randomness during the training process. Using this experiment, we show how aggregation techniques such as ensemble quantiles can reduce bias, and we give an idea of the overall spread of the results. We utilize the test success chance, a simulative metric based on the empirical distribution. We also employ a post-training Monte Carlo quantization approach and introduce cumulative summation to turn counting into a stationary method and allow unbounded counts.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 62\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
