Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: CoRe-GD: A Hierarchical Framework for Scalable Graph Visualization with GNNs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Graph Visualization, also known as Graph Drawing, aims to find geometric embeddings of graphs that optimize certain criteria. Stress is a widely used metric; stress is minimized when every pair of nodes is positioned at their shortest path distance. However, stress optimization presents computational challenges due to its inherent complexity and is usually solved using heuristics in practice. We introduce a scalable Graph Neural Network (GNN) based Graph Drawing framework with sub-quadratic runtime that can learn to optimize stress. Inspired by classical stress optimization techniques and force-directed layout algorithms, we create a coarsening hierarchy for the input graph. Beginning at the coarsest level, we iteratively refine and un-coarsen the layout, until we generate an embedding for the original graph. To enhance information propagation within the network, we propose a novel positional rewiring technique based on intermediate node positions. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining scalable.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
