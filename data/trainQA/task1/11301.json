      "content": "Paper Title: Comparing Quantum Annealing and Spiking Neuromorphic Computing for Sampling Binary Sparse Coding QUBO Problems\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We consider the problem of computing a sparse binary representation of an image. To be precise, given an image and an overcomplete, non-orthonormal basis, we aim to find a sparse binary vector indicating the minimal set of basis vectors that when added together best reconstruct the given input. We formulate this problem with an L2subscriptùêø2L_{2} loss on the reconstruction error, and an L0subscriptùêø0L_{0} (or, equivalently, an L1subscriptùêø1L_{1}) loss on the binary vector enforcing sparsity. This yields a quadratic binary optimization problem (QUBO), whose optimal solution(s) in general is NP-hard to find. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, the method of unsupervised and unnormalized dictionary feature learning for a desired sparsity level to best match the data is presented. Second, we solve the sparse representation QUBO by implementing it both on a D-Wave quantum annealer with Pegasus chip connectivity via minor embedding, as well as on the Intel Loihi 2 spiking neuromorphic processor. On the D-Wave quantum annealer, we sample from the sparse representation QUBO using parallel quantum annealing combined with quantum evolution Monte Carlo, also known as iterated reverse annealing. On the Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip, we use a stochastic winner take all network of neurons. The solutions are benchmarked against simulated annealing, a classical heuristic, and the optimal solutions are computed using CPLEX. Iterated reverse quantum annealing performs similarly to simulated annealing, although simulated annealing is always able to sample the optimal solution whereas quantum annealing was not always able to. The Loihi 2 solutions that are sampled are on average more sparse than the solutions from any of the other methods. We demonstrate that both quantum annealing and neuromorphic computing are suitable for binary sparse coding QUBOs, and that Loihi 2 outperforms a D-Wave quantum annealer standard linear-schedule anneal, while for these types of QUBOs, iterated reverse quantum annealing performs much better than both unmodified linear-schedule quantum annealing and iterated warm starting on Loihi 2.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
