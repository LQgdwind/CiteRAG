Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 53 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Adaptive Discounting of Training Time Attacks\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Among the most insidious attacks on Reinforcement Learning (RL) solutions are training-time attacks (TTAs) that create loopholes and backdoors in the learned behaviour. Not limited to a simple disruption, constructive TTAs (C-TTAs) are now available, where the attacker forces a specific, target behaviour upon a training RL agent (victim). However, even state-of-the-art C-TTAs focus on target behaviours that could be naturally adopted by the victim if not for a particular feature of the environment dynamics, which C-TTAs exploit. In this work, we show that a C-TTA is possible even when the target behaviour is un-adoptable due to both environment dynamics as well as non-optimality with respect to the victim‚Äôs objective(s). To find efficient attacks in this context, we develop a specialised flavour of the DDPG algorithm, which we term Œ≥ùõæ\\gammaDDPG, that learns this stronger version of C-TTA. Œ≥ùõæ\\gammaDDPG dynamically alters the attack policy planning horizon based on the victim‚Äôs current behaviour. This improves effort distribution throughout the attack timeline and reduces the effect of uncertainty the attacker has about the victim. To demonstrate the features of our method and better relate the results to prior research, we borrow a 3D grid domain from a state-of-the-art C-TTA for our experiments. Code is available at ‚Äùbit.ly/github-rb-gDDPG‚Äù.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
