      "content": "Paper Title: The Impact of Distance on Performance and Scalability of Distributed Database Systems in Hybrid Clouds\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The increasing need for managing big data has led the emergence of advanced database management systems, e.g., NoSQL or SQL Clusters, which are usually deployed and operated on a cloud computing infrastructure. These database management systems are also called ”big data management solutions”, whose performance and scalability play a critical role in the operations of ”big data applications”. Recently, there has been increased efforts aimed at evaluating the performance and scalability of ”big data management solutions” hosted by either private or public cloud datacenters. However, there has been little work on evaluating the performance and scalability of ”big data management solutions” in hybrid cloud arrangement, where an enterprise leverages a public cloud along with it’s own private cloud for it’s processing or storage needs. In the hybrid cloud model, the distance between private and public cloud datacenters can be one of the key factors that can affect the throughput performance (simply throughput) of ”big data management solutions.” Hence, any evaluation of the performance and scalability of ”big data management solutions” in a hybrid cloud arrangement needs to consider the impact of distance between a private cloud and a public cloud. In this article, we present a detailed evaluation of throughput performance, scalability, and VMs size vs. VMs number for six modern databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, Riak, CouchDB, Redis, and MySQL Cluster) in a hybrid cloud arrangement, consisting of a private cloud in Adelaide and Azure based public cloud datacenters located in Sydeny, Mumbai and Virginia regions. Based systematic and thorough evaluation, we make the following important observations. First, as the distance between private and public clouds increases, the throughput performance of most databases reduces. Second, MongoDB obtains the best throughput performance, followed by MySQL Cluster under the default setting in terms of replicas number and consistency mechanism. Whilst Cassandra exposes the most fluctuation in through performance, the throughput of other databases initially reduces and then increases as the number of nodes burst into the public cloud increases. Third, vertical scalability improves the throughput of databases more than the horizontal scalability. Forth, exploiting bigger VMs (i.e., a VM with more cores) rather than more VMs with less cores can increase throughput performance for Cassandra by a factor of at most 800%, for Riak by 30%, and for Redis by 10%.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
