      "content": "Paper Title: Why we couldn’t prove SETH hardness of the Closest Vector Problem for even norms!\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Recent work [BGS17, ABGS21] has shown 𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧𝖲𝖤𝖳𝖧\\mathsf{SETH} hardness of 𝖢𝖵𝖯𝖢𝖵𝖯\\mathsf{CVP} in the ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p} norm for any p𝑝p that is not an even integer. This result was shown by giving a Karp reduction from k𝑘k-𝖲𝖠𝖳𝖲𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{SAT} on n𝑛n variables to 𝖢𝖵𝖯𝖢𝖵𝖯\\mathsf{CVP} on a lattice of rank n𝑛n. In this work, we show a barrier towards proving a similar result for 𝖢𝖵𝖯𝖢𝖵𝖯\\mathsf{CVP} in the ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\ell_{p} norm where p𝑝p is an even integer. We show that for any c>0𝑐0c>0, if for every k>0𝑘0k>0, there exists an efficient reduction that maps a k𝑘k-𝖲𝖠𝖳𝖲𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{SAT} instance on n𝑛n variables to a 𝖢𝖵𝖯𝖢𝖵𝖯\\mathsf{CVP} instance for a lattice of rank at most ncsuperscript𝑛𝑐n^{c} in the Euclidean norm, then 𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯⊂𝖭𝖯/𝖯𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯𝖯𝗈𝗅𝗒\\mathsf{coNP}\\subset\\mathsf{NP}/\\mathsf{Poly}. We prove a similar result for 𝖢𝖵𝖯𝖢𝖵𝖯\\mathsf{CVP} for all even norms under a mild additional promise that the ratio of the distance of the target from the lattice and the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice is bounded by exp⁡(nO​(1))superscript𝑛𝑂1\\exp(n^{O(1)}). Furthermore, we show that for any c>0𝑐0c>0, and any even integer p𝑝p, if for every k>0𝑘0k>0, there exists an efficient reduction that maps a k𝑘k-𝖲𝖠𝖳𝖲𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{SAT} instance on n𝑛n variables to a 𝖲𝖵𝖯psubscript𝖲𝖵𝖯𝑝\\mathsf{SVP}_{p} instance for a lattice of rank at most ncsuperscript𝑛𝑐n^{c}, then 𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯⊂𝖭𝖯/𝖯𝗈𝗅𝗒𝖼𝗈𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯𝖯𝗈𝗅𝗒\\mathsf{coNP}\\subset\\mathsf{NP}/\\mathsf{Poly}.111The result for 𝖲𝖵𝖯𝖲𝖵𝖯\\mathsf{SVP} does not require any additional promise. While prior results have indicated that lattice problems in the ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\ell_{2} norm (Euclidean norm) are easier than lattice problems in other norms, this is the first result that shows a separation between these problems. We achieve this by using a result by Dell and van Melkebeek [DvM14] on the impossibility of the existence of a reduction that compresses an arbitrary k𝑘k-𝖲𝖠𝖳𝖲𝖠𝖳\\mathsf{SAT} instance into a string of length 𝒪​(nk−ε)𝒪superscript𝑛𝑘𝜀\\mathcal{O}(n^{k-\\varepsilon}) for any ε>0𝜀0\\varepsilon>0. In addition to 𝖢𝖵𝖯𝖢𝖵𝖯\\mathsf{CVP}, we also show that the same result holds for the Subset-Sum problem using similar techniques.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 53 most likely reference titles for this paper.
