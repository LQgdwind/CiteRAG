      "content": "Paper Title: A new approach for predicting the Quality of Experience in multimedia services using machine learning\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In today’s world, the internet is recognized as one of the essentials of human life, playing a significant role in communications, business, and lifestyle. The quality of internet services can have widespread negative impacts on individual and social levels. Consequently, Quality of Service (QoS) has become a fundamental necessity for service providers in a competitive market aiming to offer superior services. The success and survival of these providers depend on their ability to maintain high service quality and ensure customer satisfaction. Alongside QoS, the concept of Quality of Experience (QoE) has emerged with the development of telephony networks. QoE focuses on the user’s satisfaction with the service, helping operators to adjust their services to meet user expectations. However, accurately measuring and evaluating QoE poses challenges due to its complex nature and the lack of precise models for real-time feedback from users. In recent research, there is a trend towards utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict user QoE. Researchers aim to develop accurate models by leveraging large volumes of data from network and user interactions, considering various real-world scenarios. Despite the complexity of network environments, this research strives to provide an efficient and practical framework for improving and evaluating QoE. This study presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating and measuring QoE in multimedia services, adhering to the ITU-T P.1203 standard. The framework includes automated data collection processes and uses machine learning algorithms to predict user satisfaction based on key network parameters. By collecting over 20,000 data records from different network conditions and users, the Random Forest model achieved a prediction accuracy of 95.8% for user satisfaction. This approach allows operators to dynamically and optimally allocate network resources in real-time, maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction with minimal costs.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 42 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 42\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
