Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: NAND-SPIN-Based Processing-in-MRAM Architecture for Convolutional Neural Network Acceleration\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The performance and efficiency of running large-scale datasets on traditional computing systems exhibit critical bottlenecks due to the existing “power wall” and “memory wall” problems. To resolve those problems, processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures are developed to bring computation logic in or near memory to alleviate the bandwidth limitations during data transmission. NAND-like spintronics memory (NAND-SPIN) is one kind of promising magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) with low write energy and high integration density, and it can be employed to perform efficient in-memory computation operations. In this work, we propose a NAND-SPIN-based PIM architecture for efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) acceleration. A straightforward data mapping scheme is exploited to improve the parallelism while reducing data movements. Benefiting from the excellent characteristics of NAND-SPIN and in-memory processing architecture, experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve ∼similar-to\\sim2.6×\\times speedup and ∼similar-to\\sim1.4×\\times improvement in energy efficiency over state-of-the-art PIM solutions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
