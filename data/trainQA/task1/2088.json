Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learnable Gabor modulated complex-valued networks for orientation robustness\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Robustness to transformation is desirable in many computer vision tasks, given that input data often exhibits pose variance. While translation invariance and equivariance is a documented phenomenon of CNNs, sensitivity to other transformations is typically encouraged through data augmentation. We investigate the modulation of complex valued convolutional weights with learned Gabor filters to enable orientation robustness. The resulting network can generate orientation dependent features free of interpolation with a single set of learnable rotation-governing parameters. By choosing to either retain or pool orientation channels, the choice of equivariance versus invariance can be directly controlled. Moreover, we introduce rotational weight-tying through a proposed cyclic Gabor convolution, further enabling generalisation over rotations. We combine these innovations into Learnable Gabor Convolutional Networks (LGCNs), that are parameter-efficient and offer increased model complexity. We demonstrate their rotation invariance and equivariance on MNIST, BSD and a dataset of simulated and real astronomical images of Galactic cirri.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
