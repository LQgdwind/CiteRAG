Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Direct Distillation between Different Domains\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to learn a compact student network using knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher network, where both networks are trained on data from the same distribution. However, in practical applications, the student network may be required to perform in a new scenario (i.e., the target domain), which usually exhibits significant differences from the known scenario of the teacher network (i.e., the source domain). The traditional domain adaptation techniques can be integrated with KD in a two-stage process to bridge the domain gap, but the ultimate reliability of two-stage approaches tends to be limited due to the high computational consumption and the additional errors accumulated from both stages. To solve this problem, we propose a new one-stage method dubbed “Direct Distillation between Different Domains” (4Ds). We first design a learnable adapter based on the Fourier transform to separate the domain-invariant knowledge from the domain-specific knowledge. Then, we build a fusion-activation mechanism to transfer the valuable domain-invariant knowledge to the student network, while simultaneously encouraging the adapter within the teacher network to learn the domain-specific knowledge of the target data. As a result, the teacher network can effectively transfer categorical knowledge that aligns with the target domain of the student network. Intensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed 4Ds method successfully produces reliable student networks and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
