Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 49 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Contribution of Lyrics and Acoustics to Collaborative Understanding of Mood\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract In this work, we study the association between song lyrics and mood through a data-driven analysis. Our data set consists of nearly one million songs, with song-mood associations derived from user playlists on the Spotify streaming platform. We take advantage of state-of-the-art natural language processing models based on transformers to learn the association between the lyrics and moods. We find that a pretrained transformer-based language model in a zero-shot setting – i.e., out of the box with no further training on our data – is powerful for capturing song-mood associations. Moreover, we illustrate that training on song-mood associations results in a highly accurate model that predicts these associations for unseen songs. Furthermore, by comparing the prediction of a model using lyrics with one using acoustic features, we observe that the relative importance of lyrics for mood prediction in comparison with acoustics depends on the specific mood. Finally, we verify if the models are capturing the same information about lyrics and acoustics as humans through an annotation task where we obtain human judgments of mood-song relevance based on lyrics and acoustics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 49 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
