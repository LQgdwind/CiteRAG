      "content": "Paper Title: Randomized polynomial-time equivalence between determinant and trace-IMM equivalence tests\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Equivalence testing for a polynomial family {gm}m∈ℕsubscriptsubscript𝑔𝑚𝑚ℕ\\{g_{m}\\}_{m\\in\\mathbb{N}} over a field 𝔽𝔽\\mathbb{F} is the following problem: Given black-box access to an n𝑛n-variate polynomial f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f({\\mathbf{x}}), where n𝑛n is the number of variables in gmsubscript𝑔𝑚g_{m} for some m∈ℕ𝑚ℕm\\in\\mathbb{N}, check if there exists an A∈GL​(n,𝔽)𝐴GL𝑛𝔽A\\in\\text{GL}(n,\\mathbb{F}) such that f​(𝐱)=gm​(A​𝐱)𝑓𝐱subscript𝑔𝑚𝐴𝐱f({\\mathbf{x}})=g_{m}(A{\\mathbf{x}}). If yes, then output such an A𝐴A. The complexity of equivalence testing has been studied for a number of important polynomial families, including the determinant (Det) and the family of iterated matrix multiplication polynomials. Two popular variants of the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial are: IMMw,dsubscriptIMM𝑤𝑑\\text{IMM}_{w,d} (the (1,1)11(1,1) entry of the product of d𝑑d many w×w𝑤𝑤w\\times w symbolic matrices) and Tr-IMMw,dsubscriptTr-IMM𝑤𝑑\\text{Tr}\\mbox{-}\\text{IMM}_{w,d} (the trace of the product of d𝑑d many w×w𝑤𝑤w\\times w symbolic matrices). The families – Det, IMM and Tr-IMM – are 𝖵𝖡𝖯𝖵𝖡𝖯\\mathsf{VBP}-complete under p𝑝p-projections, and so, in this sense, they have the same complexity. But, do they have the same equivalence testing complexity? We show that the answer is “yes\" for Det and Tr-IMM (modulo the use of randomness). The above result may appear a bit surprising as the complexity of equivalence testing for IMM and that for Det are quite different over ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q}: a randomized polynomial-time equivalence testing for IMM over ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q} is known [KNST19], whereas [GGKS19] showed that equivalence testing for Det over ℚℚ\\mathbb{Q} is integer factoring hard (under randomized reductions and assuming GRH). To our knowledge, the complexity of equivalence testing for Tr-IMM was not known before this work. We show that, despite the syntactic similarity between IMM and Tr-IMM, equivalence testing for Tr-IMM and that for Det are randomized polynomial-time Turing reducible to each other over any field of characteristic zero or sufficiently large. The result is obtained by connecting the two problems via another well-studied problem in computer algebra, namely the full matrix algebra isomorphism problem (𝖥𝖬𝖠𝖨𝖥𝖬𝖠𝖨\\mathsf{FMAI}). In particular, we prove the following: 1. Testing equivalence of polynomials to Tr-IMMw,dsubscriptTr-IMM𝑤𝑑\\text{Tr}\\mbox{-}\\text{IMM}_{w,d}, for d≥3𝑑3d\\geq 3 and w≥2𝑤2w\\geq 2, is randomized polynomial-time Turing reducible to testing equivalence of polynomials to DetwsubscriptDet𝑤\\text{Det}_{w}, the determinant of the w×w𝑤𝑤w\\times w matrix of formal variables. (Here, d𝑑d need not be a constant.) 2. 𝖥𝖬𝖠𝖨𝖥𝖬𝖠𝖨\\mathsf{FMAI} is randomized polynomial-time Turing reducible to equivalence testing (in fact, to tensor isomorphism testing) for the family of matrix multiplication tensors {Tr-IMMw,3}w∈ℕsubscriptsubscriptTr-IMM𝑤3𝑤ℕ\\{\\text{Tr}\\mbox{-}\\text{IMM}_{w,3}\\}_{w\\in\\mathbb{N}}. These results, in conjunction with the randomized poly-time reduction (shown in [GGKS19]) from determinant equivalence testing to 𝖥𝖬𝖠𝖨𝖥𝖬𝖠𝖨\\mathsf{FMAI}, imply that the four problems – 𝖥𝖬𝖠𝖨𝖥𝖬𝖠𝖨\\mathsf{FMAI}, equivalence testing for Tr-IMM and for Det, and the 333-tensor isomorphism problem for the family of matrix multiplication tensors – are randomized poly-time equivalent under Turing reductions.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
