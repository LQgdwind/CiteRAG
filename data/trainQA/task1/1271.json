Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1. Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\n   Abstract: We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks.\n\n2.

      "content": "Paper Title: 1 Introduction\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Linial’s famous color reduction algorithm reduces a given m𝑚m-coloring of a graph with maximum degree ΔΔ\\Delta to a O​(Δ2​log⁡m)𝑂superscriptΔ2𝑚O(\\Delta^{2}\\log m)-coloring, in a single round in the LOCAL model. We show a similar result when nodes are restricted to choose their color from a list of allowed colors: given an m𝑚m-coloring in a directed graph of maximum outdegree β𝛽\\beta, if every node has a list of size Ω​(β2​(log⁡β+log⁡log⁡m+log⁡log⁡|𝒞|))Ωsuperscript𝛽2𝛽𝑚𝒞\\Omega(\\beta^{2}(\\log\\beta+\\log\\log m+\\log\\log|\\mathcal{C}|)) from a color space 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} then they can select a color in two rounds in the LOCAL model. Moreover, the communication of a node essentially consists of sending its list to the neighbors. This is obtained as part of a framework that also contains Linial’s color reduction (with an alternative proof) as a special case. Our result also leads to a defective list coloring algorithm. As a corollary, we improve the state-of-the-art truly local (d​e​g+1)𝑑𝑒𝑔1(deg+1)-list coloring algorithm from Barenboim et al. [PODC’18] by slightly reducing the runtime to O​(Δ​log⁡Δ)+log∗⁡n𝑂ΔΔsuperscript𝑛O(\\sqrt{\\Delta\\log\\Delta})+\\log^{*}n and significantly reducing the message size (from huge to roughly ΔΔ\\Delta). Our techniques are inspired by the local conflict coloring framework of Fraigniaud et al. [FOCS’16].\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
