Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exploiting BERT For Multimodal Target Sentiment Classification Through Input Space Translation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Multimodal target/aspect sentiment classification combines multimodal sentiment analysis and aspect/target sentiment classification. The goal of the task is to combine vision and language to understand the sentiment towards a target entity in a sentence. Twitter is an ideal setting for the task because it is inherently multimodal, highly emotional, and affects real world events. However, multimodal tweets are short and accompanied by complex, possibly irrelevant images. We introduce a two-stream model that translates images in input space using an object-aware transformer followed by a single-pass non-autoregressive text generation approach. We then leverage the translation to construct an auxiliary sentence that provides multimodal information to a language model. Our approach increases the amount of text available to the language model and distills the object-level information in complex images. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on two multimodal Twitter datasets without modifying the internals of the language model to accept multimodal data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our translation. In addition, we explain a failure mode of a popular approach for aspect sentiment analysis when applied to tweets. Our code is available at https://github.com/codezakh/exploiting-BERT-thru-translation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 45\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
