Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 45 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Anonymizing Sensor Data on the Edge: A Representation Learning and Transformation Approach\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. The abundance of data collected by sensors in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the success of deep neural networks in uncovering hidden patterns in time series data have led to mounting privacy concerns. This is because private and sensitive information can be potentially learned from sensor data by applications that have access to this data. In this paper, we aim to examine the tradeoff between utility and privacy loss by learning low-dimensional representations that are useful for data obfuscation. We propose deterministic and probabilistic transformations in the latent space of a variational autoencoder to synthesize time series data such that intrusive inferences are prevented while desired inferences can still be made with sufficient accuracy. In the deterministic case, we use a linear transformation to move the representation of input data in the latent space such that the reconstructed data is likely to have the same public attribute but a different private attribute than the original input data. In the probabilistic case, we apply the linear transformation to the latent representation of input data with some probability. We compare our technique with autoencoder-based anonymization techniques and additionally show that it can anonymize data in real time on resource-constrained edge devices.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 45 most likely reference titles for this paper.
