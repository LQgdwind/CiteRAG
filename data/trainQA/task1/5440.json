Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Towards Effective and Robust Neural Trojan Defenses via Input Filtering\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Trojan attacks on deep neural networks are both dangerous and surreptitious. Over the past few years, Trojan attacks have advanced from using only a single input-agnostic trigger and targeting only one class to using multiple, input-specific triggers and targeting multiple classes. However, Trojan defenses have not caught up with this development. Most defense methods still make inadequate assumptions about Trojan triggers and target classes, thus, can be easily circumvented by modern Trojan attacks. To deal with this problem, we propose two novel “filtering” defenses called Variational Input Filtering (VIF) and Adversarial Input Filtering (AIF) which leverage lossy data compression and adversarial learning respectively to effectively purify potential Trojan triggers in the input at run time without making assumptions about the number of triggers/target classes or the input dependence property of triggers. In addition, we introduce a new defense mechanism called “Filtering-then-Contrasting” (FtC) which helps avoid the drop in classification accuracy on clean data caused by “filtering”, and combine it with VIF/AIF to derive new defenses of this kind. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies show that our proposed defenses significantly outperform well-known baseline defenses in mitigating five advanced Trojan attacks including two recent state-of-the-art while being quite robust to small amounts of training data and large-norm triggers.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
