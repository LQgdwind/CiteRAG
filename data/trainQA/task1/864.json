Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Data-driven Detection and Analysis of the Patterns of Creaky Voice\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract This paper investigates the temporal excitation patterns of creaky voice. Creaky voice is a voice quality frequently used as a phrase-boundary marker, but also as a means of portraying attitude, affective states and even social status. Consequently, the automatic detection and modelling of creaky voice may have implications for speech technology applications. The acoustic characteristics of creaky voice are, however, rather distinct from modal phonation. Further, several acoustic patterns can bring about the perception of creaky voice, thereby complicating the strategies used for its automatic detection, analysis and modelling. The present study is carried out using a variety of languages, speakers, and on both read and conversational data and involves a mutual information-based assessment of the various acoustic features proposed in the literature for detecting creaky voice. These features are then exploited in classification experiments where we achieve an appreciable improvement in detection accuracy compared to the state of the art. Both experiments clearly highlight the presence of several creaky patterns. A subsequent qualitative and quantitative analysis of the identified patterns is provided, which reveals a considerable speaker-dependent variability in the usage of these creaky patterns. We also investigate how creaky voice detection systems perform across creaky patterns.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
