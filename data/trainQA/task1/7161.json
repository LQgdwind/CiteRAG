Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: MetaEMS: A Meta Reinforcement Learning-based Control Framework for Building Energy Management System\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The building sector has been recognized as one of the primary sectors for worldwide energy consumption. Improving the energy efficiency of the building sector can help reduce the operation cost and reduce the greenhouse gas emission. The energy management system (EMS) can monitor and control the operations of built-in appliances in buildings, so an efficient EMS is of crucial importance to improve the building operation efficiency and maintain safe operations. With the growing penetration of renewable energy and electrical appliances, increasing attention has been paid to the development of intelligent building EMS. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied for building EMS and has shown promising potential. However, most of the current RL-based EMS solutions would need a large amount of data to learn a reliable control policy, which limits the applicability of these solutions in the real world. In this work, we propose MetaEMS, which can help achieve better energy management performance with the benefits of RL and meta-learning. Experiment results showcase that our proposed MetaEMS can adapt faster to environment changes and perform better in most situations compared with other baselines.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
