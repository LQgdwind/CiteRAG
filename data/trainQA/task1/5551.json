Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Implicit Feature Decoupling with Depthwise Quantization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Quantization has been applied to multiple domains in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We propose Depthwise Quantization (DQ) where quantization is applied to a decomposed sub-tensor along the feature axis of weak statistical dependence. The feature decomposition leads to an exponential increase in representation capacity with a linear increase in memory and parameter cost. In addition, DQ can be directly applied to existing encoder-decoder frameworks without modification of the DNN architecture. We use DQ in the context of Hierarchical Auto-Encoders and train end-to-end on an image feature representation. We provide an analysis of the cross-correlation between spatial and channel features and propose a decomposition of the image feature representation along the channel axis. The improved performance of the depthwise operator is due to the increased representation capacity from implicit feature decoupling. We evaluate DQ on the likelihood estimation task, where it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32 and ImageNet-64. We progressively train with increasing image size a single hierarchical model that uses 69% fewer parameters and has faster convergence than the previous work.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
