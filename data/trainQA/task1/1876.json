Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: Exponential Negation of a Probability Distribution\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Negation operation is important in intelligent information processing. Different with existing arithmetic negation, an exponential negation is presented in this paper. The new negation can be seen as a kind of geometry negation. Some basic properties of the proposed negation are investigated, we find that the fix point is the uniform probability distribution. The proposed exponential negation is an entropy increase operation and all the probability distributions will converge to the uniform distribution after multiple negation iterations. The convergence speed of the proposed negation is also faster than the existed negation. The number of iterations of convergence is inversely proportional to the number of elements in the distribution. Some numerical examples are used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed negation.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
