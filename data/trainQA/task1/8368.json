Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 48 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Distrust in (X)AI - Measurement Artifact or Distinct Construct?\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract. Trust is a key motivation in developing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). However, researchers attempting to measure trust in AI face numerous challenges, such as different trust conceptualizations, simplified experimental tasks that may not induce uncertainty as a prerequisite for trust, and the lack of validated trust questionnaires in the context of AI. While acknowledging these issues, we have identified a further challenge that currently seems underappreciated - the potential distinction between trust as one construct and distrust as a second construct independent of trust. While there has been long-standing academic discourse for this distinction and arguments for both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional conceptualization of trust, distrust seems relatively understudied in XAI. In this position paper, we not only highlight the theoretical arguments for distrust as a distinct construct from trust but also contextualize psychometric evidence that likewise favors a distinction between trust and distrust. It remains to be investigated whether the available psychometric evidence is sufficient for the existence of distrust or whether distrust is merely a measurement artifact. Nevertheless, the XAI community should remain receptive to considering trust and distrust for a more comprehensive understanding of these two relevant constructs in XAI.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 48 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 48\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles. The reasoning field is required to explain your prediction logic."
