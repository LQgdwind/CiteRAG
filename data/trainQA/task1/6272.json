Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Defending Adversarial Examples by Negative Correlation Ensemble\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The security issues in DNNs, such as adversarial examples, have attracted much attention. Adversarial examples refer to the examples which are capable to induce the DNNs return completely predictions by introducing carefully designed perturbations. Obviously, adversarial examples bring great security risks to the development of deep learning. Recently, Some defense approaches against adversarial examples have been proposed, however, in our opinion, the performance of these approaches are still limited. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble defense approach named the Negative Correlation Ensemble (NCEn), which achieves compelling results by introducing gradient directions and gradient magnitudes of each member in the ensemble negatively correlated and at the same time, reducing the transferability of adversarial examples among them. Extensive experiments have been conducted, and the results demonstrate that NCEn can improve the adversarial robustness of ensembles effectively.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
