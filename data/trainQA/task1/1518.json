Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 51 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Information-Theoretic Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Continuous Approximations\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Many real-world applications involve black-box optimization of multiple objectives using continuous function approximations that trade-off accuracy and resource cost of evaluation. For example, in rocket launching research, we need to find designs that trade-off return-time and angular distance using continuous-fidelity simulators (e.g., varying tolerance parameter to trade-off simulation time and accuracy) for design evaluations. The goal is to approximate the optimal Pareto set by minimizing the cost for evaluations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach referred to as information-Theoretic Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Continuous Approximations (iMOCA) to solve this problem. The key idea is to select the sequence of input and function approximations for multiple objectives which maximize the information gain per unit cost for the optimal Pareto front. Our experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that iMOCA significantly improves over existing single-fidelity methods.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 51 most likely reference titles for this paper.
