      "content": "Paper Title: The Power Word Problem in Graph Products\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The power word problem for a group G𝐺G asks whether an expression u1x1​⋯​unxnsuperscriptsubscript𝑢1subscript𝑥1⋯superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑛subscript𝑥𝑛u_{1}^{x_{1}}\\cdots u_{n}^{x_{n}}, where the uisubscript𝑢𝑖u_{i} are words over a finite set of generators of G𝐺G and the xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i} binary encoded integers, is equal to the identity of G𝐺G. It is a restriction of the compressed word problem, where the input word is represented by a straight-line program (i.e., an algebraic circuit over G𝐺G). We start by showing some easy results concerning the power word problem. In particular, the power word problem for a group G𝐺G is 𝗎𝖭𝖢1superscript𝗎𝖭𝖢1\\mathsf{uNC}^{1}-many-one reducible to the power word problem for a finite-index subgroup of G𝐺G. For our main result, we consider graph products of groups that do not have elements of order two. We show that the power word problem in a fixed such graph product is 𝖠𝖢0superscript𝖠𝖢0\\mathsf{AC}^{0}-Turing-reducible to the word problem for the free group F2subscript𝐹2F_{2} and the power word problems of the base groups. Furthermore, we look into the uniform power word problem in a graph product, where the dependence graph and the base groups are part of the input. Given a class of finitely generated groups 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C} without order two elements, the uniform power word problem in a graph product can be solved in 𝖠𝖢0​[𝖢=​𝖫UPowWP⁡(𝒞)]superscript𝖠𝖢0delimited-[]subscript𝖢superscript𝖫UPowWP𝒞\\mathsf{AC}^{0}[\\mathsf{C}_{=}\\mathsf{L}^{\\operatorname{UPowWP}(\\mathcal{C})}], where UPowWP⁡(𝒞)UPowWP𝒞\\operatorname{UPowWP}(\\mathcal{C}) denotes the uniform power word problem for groups from the class 𝒞𝒞\\mathcal{C}. As a consequence of our results, the uniform knapsack problem in right-angled Artin groups is 𝖭𝖯𝖭𝖯\\mathsf{NP}-complete. The present paper is a combination of the two conference papers Lohrey and Weiß (2019b); Stober and Weiß (2022a). In Stober and Weiß (2022a) and previous iterations of this paper our results on graph products were wrongly stated without the additional assumption that the base groups do not have elements of order two. In the present work we correct this mistake. While we strongly conjecture that the result as stated in Stober and Weiß (2022a) is true, our proof relies on this additional assumption.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 59 most likely reference titles for this paper.
