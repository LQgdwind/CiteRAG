Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: The Potential of Using Vision Videos for CrowdRE: Video Comments as a Source of Feedback\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Vision videos are established for soliciting feedback and stimulating discussions in requirements engineering (RE) practices such as focus groups. Different researchers motivated the transfer of these benefits into crowd-based RE (CrowdRE) by using vision videos on social media platforms. So far, however, little research explored the potential of using vision videos for CrowdRE in detail. In this paper, we analyze and assess this potential, in particular, focusing on video comments as a source of feedback. In a case study, we analyzed 4505 comments on a vision video from YouTube. We found that the video solicited 2770 comments from 2660 viewers in four days. This is more than 50% of all comments the video received in four years. Even though only a certain fraction of these comments are relevant to RE, the relevant comments address typical intentions and topics of user feedback, such as feature request or problem report. Besides the typical user feedback categories, we found more than 300 comments that address the topic safety which has not appeared in previous analyses of user feedback. In an automated analysis, we compared the performance of three machine learning algorithms on classifying the video comments. Despite certain differences, the algorithms classified the video comments well. Based on these findings, we conclude that the use of vision videos for CrowdRE has a large potential. Despite the preliminary nature of the case study, we are optimistic that vision videos can motivate stakeholders to actively participate in a crowd and solicit numerous of video comments as a valuable source of feedback.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 52\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
