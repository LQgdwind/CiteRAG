Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 43 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: AdvCat: Domain-Agnostic Robustness Assessment for Cybersecurity-Critical Applications with Categorical Inputs\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Machine Learning-as-a-Service systems (MLaaS) have been largely developed for cybersecurity-critical applications, such as detecting network intrusions and fake news campaigns. Despite effectiveness, their robustness against adversarial attacks is one of the key trust concerns for MLaaS deployment. We are thus motivated to assess the adversarial robustness of the Machine Learning models residing at the core of these security-critical applications with categorical inputs. Previous research efforts on accessing model robustness against manipulation of categorical inputs are specific to use cases and heavily depend on domain knowledge, or require white-box access to the target ML model. Such limitations prevent the robustness assessment from being as a domain-agnostic service provided to various real-world applications. We propose a provably optimal yet computationally highly efficient adversarial robustness assessment protocol for a wide band of ML-driven cybersecurity-critical applications. We demonstrate the use of the domain-agnostic robustness assessment method with substantial experimental study on fake news detection and intrusion detection problems.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 43 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 43\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
