Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 58 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7.

      "content": "Paper Title: A strong composition theorem for junta complexity and the boosting of property testers\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We prove a strong composition theorem for junta complexity and show how such theorems can be used to generically boost the performance of property testers. The ε𝜀\\varepsilon-approximate junta complexity of a function f𝑓f is the smallest integer r𝑟r such that f𝑓f is ε𝜀\\varepsilon-close to a function that depends only on r𝑟r variables. A strong composition theorem states that if f𝑓f has large ε𝜀\\varepsilon-approximate junta complexity, then g∘f𝑔𝑓g\\circ f has even larger ε​’𝜀’\\varepsilon’-approximate junta complexity, even for ε​’≫εmuch-greater-than𝜀’𝜀\\varepsilon’\\gg\\varepsilon. We develop a fairly complete understanding of this behavior, proving that the junta complexity of g∘f𝑔𝑓g\\circ f is characterized by that of f𝑓f along with the multivariate noise sensitivity of g𝑔g. For the important case of symmetric functions g𝑔g, we relate their multivariate noise sensitivity to the simpler and well-studied case of univariate noise sensitivity. We then show how strong composition theorems yield boosting algorithms for property testers: with a strong composition theorem for any class of functions, a large-distance tester for that class is immediately upgraded into one for small distances. Combining our contributions yields a booster for junta testers, and with it new implications for junta testing. This is the first boosting-type result in property testing, and we hope that the connection to composition theorems adds compelling motivation to the study of both topics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 58 most likely reference titles for this paper.
