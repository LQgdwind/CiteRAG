Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Networks for Multi-Label Classification\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Prediction of multi-dimensional labels plays an important role in machine learning problems. We found that the classical binary labels could not reflect the contents and their relationships in an instance. Hence, we propose a multi-label classification model based on interval type-2 fuzzy logic. In the proposed model, we use a deep neural network to predict the type-1 fuzzy membership of an instance and another one to predict the fuzzifiers of the membership to generate interval type-2 fuzzy memberships. We also propose a loss function to measure the similarities between binary labels in datasets and interval type-2 fuzzy memberships generated by our model. The experiments validate that our approach outperforms baselines on multi-label classification benchmarks.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper.
