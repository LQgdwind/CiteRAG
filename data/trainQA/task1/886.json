Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 55 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: ToGCom: An Asymmetric Sybil Defense\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Proof-of-work (PoW) is one of the most common techniques to defend against Sybil attacks. Unfortunately, current PoW defenses have two main drawbacks. First, they require work to be done even in the absence of attack. Second, during an attack, they require the good identities (IDs) to spend as much as the attacker. Recent theoretical work by Gupta, Saia and Young suggests the possibility of overcoming these two drawbacks. In particular, they describe a new algorithm, GMCom, that always ensures that a minority of IDs are Sybil. They show that rate at which all good IDs perform computation is O‚Äã(JG+T‚Äã(JG+1))ùëÇsuperscriptùêΩùê∫ùëásuperscriptùêΩùê∫1O(J^{G}+\\sqrt{T(J^{G}+1)}), where ùë±ùëÆsuperscriptùë±ùëÆJ^{G} is the join rate of good IDs, and ùëªùëªT is the rate at which the adversary performs computation. Unfortunately, this cost bound only holds in the case where (1) GMCom always knows the join rate of good IDs; and (2) there is a fixed constant amount of time that separates join events by good IDs. Here, we present ToGCom, which removes these two shortcomings. To do so, we design and analyze a mechanism for estimating the join rate of good IDs; and also devise a new method for setting the computational cost to join the system. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of ToGCom alongside prior PoW-based defenses. Based on our experiments, we design heuristics that further improve the performance of ToGCom by up to 333 orders of magnitude over these previous Sybil defenses.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 55 most likely reference titles for this paper.
