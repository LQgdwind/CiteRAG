Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 44 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Communication Separations for Truthful Auctions: Breaking the Two-Player Barrier\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We study the communication complexity of truthful combinatorial auctions, and in particular the case where valuations are either subadditive or single-minded, which we denote with 𝖲𝗎𝖻𝖠𝖽𝖽∪𝖲𝗂𝗇𝗀𝗅𝖾𝖬𝖲𝗎𝖻𝖠𝖽𝖽𝖲𝗂𝗇𝗀𝗅𝖾𝖬\\mathsf{SubAdd}\\cup\\mathsf{SingleM}. We show that for three bidders with valuations in 𝖲𝗎𝖻𝖠𝖽𝖽∪𝖲𝗂𝗇𝗀𝗅𝖾𝖬𝖲𝗎𝖻𝖠𝖽𝖽𝖲𝗂𝗇𝗀𝗅𝖾𝖬\\mathsf{SubAdd}\\cup\\mathsf{SingleM}, any deterministic truthful mechanism that achieves at least a 0.3660.3660.366-approximation requires exp⁡(m)𝑚\\exp(m) communication. In contrast, a natural extension of [25] yields a non-truthful poly⁡(m)poly𝑚\\operatorname{poly}(m)-communication protocol that achieves a 1212\\frac{1}{2}-approximation, demonstrating a gap between the power of truthful mechanisms and non-truthful protocols for this problem. Our approach follows the taxation complexity framework laid out in [15], but applies this framework in a setting not encompassed by the techniques used in past work. In particular, the only successful prior application of this framework uses a reduction to simultaneous protocols which only applies for two bidders [2], whereas our three-player lower bounds are stronger than what can possibly arise from a two-player construction (since a trivial truthful auction guarantees a 1212\\frac{1}{2}-approximation for two players).\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 44 most likely reference titles for this paper.
