Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3.

      "content": "Paper Title: Learning Low-dimensional Manifolds for Scoring of Tissue Microarray Images\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Tissue microarray (TMA) images have emerged as an important high-throughput tool for cancer study and the validation of biomarkers. Efforts have been dedicated to further improve the accuracy of TACOMA, a cutting-edge automatic scoring algorithm for TMA images. One major advance is due to deepTacoma, an algorithm that incorporates suitable deep representations of a group nature. Inspired by the recent advance in semi-supervised learning and deep learning, we propose mfTacoma to learn alternative deep representations in the context of TMA image scoring. In particular, mfTacoma learns the low-dimensional manifolds, a common latent structure in high dimensional data. Deep representation learning and manifold learning typically requires large data. By encoding deep representation of the manifolds as regularizing features, mfTacoma effectively leverages the manifold information that is potentially crude due to small data. Our experiments show that deep features by manifolds outperforms two alternatives‚Äîdeep features by linear manifolds with principal component analysis or by leveraging the group property.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 57\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers. This helps prevent hallucination and ensures relevance.\"\n}\n\nDo not include any text before or after the JSON. Do not include authors, venues, or years - only the paper titles.
