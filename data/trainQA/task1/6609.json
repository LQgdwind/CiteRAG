      "content": "Paper Title: A Parallel Technique for Multi-objective Bayesian Global Optimization: Using a Batch Selection of Probability of Improvement\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Bayesian global optimization (BGO) is an efficient surrogate-assisted technique for problems involving expensive evaluations. A parallel technique can be used to parallelly evaluate the true-expensive objective functions in one iteration to boost the execution time. An effective and straightforward approach is to design an acquisition function that can evaluate the performance of a bath of multiple solutions, instead of a single point/solution, in one iteration. This paper proposes five alternatives of Probability of Improvement (PoI) with multiple points in a batch (q-PoI) for multi-objective Bayesian global optimization (MOBGO), taking the covariance among multiple points into account. Both exact computational formulas and the Monte Carlo approximation algorithms for all proposed q-PoIs are provided. Based on the distribution of the multiple points relevant to the Pareto-front, the position-dependent behavior of the five q-PoIs is investigated. Moreover, the five q-PoIs are compared with the other nine state-of-the-art and recently proposed batch MOBGO algorithms on twenty bio-objective benchmarks. The empirical experiments on different variety of benchmarks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of two greedy q-PoIs (q-PoI bestsubscriptq-PoI best\\mbox{q-PoI }_{\\mbox{best}} and q-PoI allsubscriptq-PoI all\\mbox{q-PoI }_{\\mbox{all}}) on low-dimensional problems and the effectiveness of two explorative q-PoIs (q-PoI onesubscriptq-PoI one\\mbox{q-PoI }_{\\mbox{one}} and q-PoI worstsubscriptq-PoI worst\\mbox{q-PoI }_{\\mbox{worst}}) on high-dimensional problems with difficult-to-approximate Pareto front boundaries.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 57 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once.
