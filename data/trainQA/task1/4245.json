Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 50 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9.

      "content": "Paper Title: BGT-Net: Bidirectional GRU Transformer Network for Scene Graph Generation\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Scene graphs are nodes and edges consisting of objects and object-object relationships, respectively. Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to identify the objects and their relationships. We propose a bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) transformer network (BGT-Net) for the scene graph generation for images. This model implements novel object-object communication to enhance the object information using a BiGRU layer. Thus, the information of all objects in the image is available for the other objects, which can be leveraged later in the object prediction step. This object information is used in a transformer encoder to predict the object class as well as to create object-specific edge information via the use of another transformer encoder. To handle the dataset bias induced by the long-tailed relationship distribution, softening with a log-softmax function and adding a bias adaptation term to regulate the bias for every relation prediction individually showed to be an effective approach. We conducted an elaborate study on experiments and ablations using open-source datasets, i.e., Visual Genome, Open-Images, and Visual Relationship Detection datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model over state of the art.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 50 most likely reference titles for this paper. Focus on papers that are directly related to the research topic, provide foundational background, present similar methodologies, or address related problems.\n\nCRITICAL: Each title must appear exactly once. Do not repeat any title.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"titles\": [\n        \"Reference Title 1\",\n        \"Reference Title 2\",\n        \"Reference Title 3\",\n        \"Reference Title 4\",\n        \"Reference Title 50\"\n    ],\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explain why you chose these specific references based on the paper's title, abstract, and retrieved papers.
