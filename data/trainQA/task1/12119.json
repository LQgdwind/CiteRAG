      "content": "Paper Title: On the Theoretical Foundations of Data Exchange EconomiesWork supported by NSF Grants CCF-1942321 and CCF-2334461.\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract The immense success of ML systems relies heavily on large-scale, high-quality data. The high demand for such data has led to several paradigms that involve selling, exchanging, and sharing data. This naturally motivates studying economic processes involving data as an asset. However, data differs from classical economic assets in terms of free duplication – meaning there is no concept of limited supply, as data can be replicated at zero marginal cost. This distinction introduces fundamental differences between economic processes involving data and those concerning other assets. We investigate a parallel to exchange (Arrow-Debreu) markets in settings where data is the asset. In this setup, agents possessing datasets exchange data fairly and voluntarily, aiming for mutual benefit without monetary compensation. This framework is particularly relevant in settings involving non-profit organizations that seek to improve their ML models through data exchange with other organizations, yet are restricted from selling their data for profit. We propose a general framework for data exchange from first principles, focusing on two key properties: (i) fairness, ensuring that each agent receives utility proportional to their contribution to other agent utilities – agent contributions are quantifiable using well-established credit-sharing functions, such as the Shapley value, and (ii) stability, guaranteeing that no coalition of agents can identify an exchange among themselves which they all unanimously prefer to the current exchange. We show that fair and stable exchanges exist for all monotone continuous utility functions. Building on this, we investigate the computational complexity of finding approximate fair and stable exchanges. We present a local search algorithm for instances with monotone submodular utility functions, where each agent’s data contribution is measured using the Shapley value. We prove that this problem belongs to CLS (== PPAD ∩\\cap PLS) under mild assumptions. Our framework opens up several intriguing theoretical avenues for future research on data economics.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 62 most likely reference titles for this paper.
