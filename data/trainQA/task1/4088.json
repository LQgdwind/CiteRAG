Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 47 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: Random Subspace Mixture Models for Interpretable Anomaly Detection\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract We present a new subspace-based method to construct probabilistic models for high-dimensional data and highlight its use in anomaly detection. The approach is based on a statistical estimation of probability density using densities of random subspaces combined with geometric averaging. In selecting random subspaces, equal representation of each attribute is used to ensure correct statistical limits. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used to create the probability densities for each subspace with techniques included to mitigate singularities allowing for the ability to handle both numerical and categorial attributes. The number of components for each GMM is determined automatically through Bayesian information criterion to prevent overfitting. The proposed algorithm attains competitive AUC scores compared with prominent algorithms against benchmark anomaly detection datasets with the added benefits of being simple, scalable, and interpretable.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 47 most likely reference titles for this paper.
