Your task is to predict the most likely references for a given academic paper based on its title, abstract, and retrieved relevant papers.\n\nRETRIEVER INTERFACE:\n- Input: paper title + abstract\n- Output: {top_r} retrieved papers with title and abstract\n- Format: List of dictionaries with 'title' and 'abstract' fields\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1. Analyze the paper's title and abstract to understand its research area and focus\n2. Consider the retrieved papers as potential references (when available)\n3. Generate a list of predicted reference titles that would be most relevant and likely to be cited\n4. Provide reasoning for each prediction to prevent hallucination\n5. Output format: JSON object with \"titles\" array and \"reasoning\" string\n6. Generate exactly 52 most relevant reference titles (this should be at least 40 to cover all evaluation metrics)\n7. Ensure titles are realistic and appropriate for the research area\n8. Consider citation patterns in the field\n9. CRITICAL: Each title must be unique - never repeat the same title multiple times\n\nEXAMPLE:\nInput:\nTitle: \"Question Type Classification Methods Comparison\"\nAbstract: \"The paper presents a comparative study of state-of-the-art approaches for question classification task: Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN). All models use pre-trained GLoVe word embeddings and trained on human-labeled data. The best accuracy is achieved using CNN model with five convolutional layers and various kernel sizes stacked in parallel, followed by one fully connected layer. The model reached 90.7% accuracy on TREC 10 test set.\"\n\nRetrieved papers ({top_r}):\n1.

      "content": "Paper Title: HPC Storage Service Autotuning Using Variational-Autoencoder-Guided Asynchronous Bayesian Optimization\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Distributed data storage services tailored to specific applications have grown popular in the high-performance computing (HPC) community as a way to address I/O and storage challenges. These services offer a variety of specific interfaces, semantics, and data representations. They also expose many tuning parameters, making it difficult for their users to find the best configuration for a given workload and platform. To address this issue, we develop a novel variational-autoencoder-guided asynchronous Bayesian optimization method to tune HPC storage service parameters. Our approach uses transfer learning to leverage prior tuning results and use a dynamically updated surrogate model to explore the large parameter search space in a systematic way. We implement our approach within the DeepHyper open-source framework, and apply it to the autotuning of a high-energy physics workflow on Argonne’s Theta supercomputer. We show that our transfer-learning approach enables a more than 40×40\\times search speedup over random search, compared with a 2.5×2.5\\times to 10×10\\times speedup when not using transfer learning. Additionally, we show that our approach is on par with state-of-the-art autotuning frameworks in speed and outperforms them in resource utilization and parallelization capabilities.\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 52 most likely reference titles for this paper.
