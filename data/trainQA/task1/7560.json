      "content": "Paper Title: Gap Preserving Reductions Between Reconfiguration Problems1footnote 11footnote 1 A preliminary version of this paper appeared in Proc. 40th Int. Symp. on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS), 2023 [Ohs23].\n\nPaper Abstract: Abstract Combinatorial reconfiguration is a growing research field studying reachability and connectivity over the solution space of a combinatorial problem. For example, in SAT Reconfiguration, for a Boolean formula œÜùúë\\varphi and its two satisfying truth assignments œÉùóåsubscriptùúéùóå\\sigma_{\\mathsf{s}} and œÉùóçsubscriptùúéùóç\\sigma_{\\mathsf{t}}, we are asked to decide if œÉùóåsubscriptùúéùóå\\sigma_{\\mathsf{s}} can be transformed into œÉùóçsubscriptùúéùóç\\sigma_{\\mathsf{t}} by repeatedly flipping a single variable assignment at a time, while preserving every intermediate assignment satisfying œÜùúë\\varphi. We consider the approximability of optimization variants of reconfiguration problems; e.g., Maxmin SAT Reconfiguration requires to maximize the minimum fraction of satisfied clauses of œÜùúë\\varphi during transformation from œÉùóåsubscriptùúéùóå\\sigma_{\\mathsf{s}} to œÉùóçsubscriptùúéùóç\\sigma_{\\mathsf{t}}. Solving such optimization variants approximately, we may be able to acquire a reasonable transformation comprising almost-satisfying truth assignments. In this study, we prove a series of gap-preserving reductions to give evidence that a host of reconfiguration problems are PSPACE-hard to approximate, under some plausible assumption. Our starting point is a new working hypothesis called the Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis (RIH), which asserts that a gap version of Maxmin CSP Reconfiguration is PSPACE-hard. This hypothesis may be thought of as a reconfiguration analogue of the PCP theorem [AS98, ALM+98]. Our main result is PSPACE-hardness of approximating Maxmin 333-SAT Reconfiguration of bounded occurrence under RIH. The crux of its proof is a gap-preserving reduction from Maxmin Binary CSP Reconfiguration to itself of bounded degree. Because a simple application of the degree reduction technique using expander graphs due to Papadimitriou and Yannakakis (J. Comput. Syst. Sci., 1991) [PY91] loses the perfect completeness, we develop a new trick referred to as alphabet squaring, which modifies the alphabet as if each vertex could take a pair of values simultaneously. To accomplish the soundness requirement, we further apply the expander mixing lemma and an explicit family of near-Ramanujan graphs. As an application of the main result, we demonstrate that under RIH, optimization variants of popular reconfiguration problems are PSPACE-hard to approximate, including Nondeterministic Constraint Logic due to Hearn and Demaine (Theor. Comput. Sci., 2005) [HD05, HD09], Independent Set Reconfiguration, Clique Reconfiguration, Vertex Cover Reconfiguration, and 222-SAT Reconfiguration. We finally highlight that all inapproximability results hold unconditionally as long as ‚ÄúPSPACE-hard‚Äù is replaced by ‚ÄúNP-hard.‚Äù\n\n{retrieved_text}\n\nGenerate exactly 46 most likely reference titles for this paper.
